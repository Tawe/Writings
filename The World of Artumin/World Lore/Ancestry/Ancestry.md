### 🪨 **Cultural Overview**

The Telma are a resilient people shaped—literally and spiritually—by centuries spent living in deep caves, high crags, and seismic borderlands. Their skin bears **natural stone striations**, often mistaken for tattoos but actually inherited mineral-like etchings that trace familial lineages. Telma culture values **steadfastness, ancestral duty, and spiritual grounding**, believing that the **earth remembers what the mind forgets**.

- **Speech and Gesture:** Telma speak slowly and with intention. Silence is not a void in their culture—it is a form of listening.
- **Community Structure:** Tribal-communal; led by **Stonecallers**, who interpret tremors, memory stones, and ancestral signs
- **Coming of Age:** A Telma youth must spend three days in silence beneath the ground and return with a memory they never lived but somehow knew—proof of ancestral resonance

### 🧠 **Mindset & Philosophy**

- “**To rush is to shatter.**” Telma view haste as a dangerous, brittle thing.
- They prize **internal strength, emotional endurance, and quiet wisdom** over outward charisma.
- Most Telma see time not as linear, but **layered like strata**—every decision embedded in what came before.

This philosophy makes them deeply loyal, difficult to sway, and sometimes slow to adapt—but when they commit, **they hold longer than steel**.
