### 🧱 Cultural Overview

Three centuries ago, the orcs were the world’s cautionary tale—chaotic raiders, brutes of war, feared and reviled in equal measure. But the **Night of Iron Rain** changed everything. Six war-chiefs vanished. A new figure rose: the **Voice of Stillness**, a prophet-scholar who preached restraint, internal mastery, and the death of needless blood.

This began what Orcstagin now call **The Great Tempering**—a cultural shift from chaos to calm. Orcs did not forget their power. They learned to seal it.

Today, the Orcstagin are best known not for violence, but for their **unflinching presence**. They occupy roles that demand self-regulation, high-stakes decision-making, and disciplined clarity.

- **Social Structure:** Guided by Elders of the Still, each clan maintains a lineage of ethical codes rather than conquest banners
- **Speech & Tone:** Steady, resonant, and economical; interruptions are culturally taboo
- **Coming of Age:** Youths undergo the Rite of Control—isolated meditation under physical duress until they can recite their clan’s oaths without tremor

### 🧠 Mindset & Philosophy

> _"We are not the flame. We are the stone that remembers it."_

- **Calm is sacred.** Emotional outbursts are signs of immaturity.
- **Violence is last.** To strike in haste is to dishonor lineage.
- **Legacy is not won—it is curated.** Quiet stewardship outweighs noisy victory.

They do not deny their chaotic roots—they master them, daily.

### 🪒 Physical Traits (Flavor Notes)

- Powerful frames with natural muscle density and heavy bone structure
- Skin tones range from coal-gray to warm bronze, often with jagged jaw ridges or tusk stubs
- Eyes are deep-set and typically dark; in moments of clarity, some exhibit faint ambient glow (a debated sign of inner stillness)
- Orc grooming culture prizes symmetry and intentional scarring

### 📚 Interracial Views

- **Humans:** Seen as adaptable and promising—but prone to emotional overreach
- **Dwarves:** Respected for discipline and groundedness; shared love of structure and memory
- **[[Hobgoblins]] (Alvatov):** Admired—considered kin in strategy, though colder in spirit
- **[[Telma]]:** Revered as slow-burning mirrors; Orcstagin often form spiritual friendships with them
- **Elves:** Incompatible; viewed as timeless but shallow—form without anchored weight
- **[[Kalidor]]:** Philosophically foreign; their fluid instincts clash with orcish certainty

### 🧬 Interbreeding & Kinship Dynamics

Orcs can bear children with **Humans, Dwarves, Hobgoblins, and Telma**. These offspring are not considered half-bloods—they are **lineage-weavers**, respected for bridging legacy.

However, they **cannot bear children with Elves or Kalidor**. Orc sages claim these pairings lack spiritual harmonic resonance.

Children of mixed orc lineage inherit a distinct rule:

- They can bear children with either of their parent ancestries, or with others of the same mixed lineage.
- A dwarf–orc may have children with dwarves, orcs, or other dwarf–orc mixes—but not with elves, nor unrelated hybrids.

This dynamic is tracked in formal clan-lists and impacts social planning and inheritance rights.

### ❤️ Romantic Tendencies & Social Pairings

Orcs most commonly form bonds with **humans** (for their passion and initiative) and **hobgoblins** (for mutual respect in discipline).

Dwarves are seen as strong mates but emotionally erratic. Telma are rare matches—quiet unions of shared silence and long walks.

Elves are rarely pursued romantically; orcs find their speech patterns evasive and spiritual tempo too diffuse. [[Kalidor]] are admired from afar, but relationships often founder on untranslatable values.

Love is not a storm in Orcstagin culture—it is **a stone basin**, carved slowly and meant to last.

### 🐾 Troll Divergence

Trolls were born of chaos. When orcs interbred with the last giant-bloods during the fall of the titanic empires, something changed. The children that emerged were malformed, fast-healing, wild-minded. They were cast out.

But the trolls did not fade. They adapted. They survived.

Over time, trolls became a true people—**chaos-forged, will-hardened, spiritually distinct**. They are no longer seen as "orc-adjacent," but as their own sovereign ancestry.

- Trolls are respected—but not embraced. Where orcs mastered impulse, trolls exalted it.
- Rare pacts are made in times of siege or great war, but day-to-day life sees the two lineages remain apart.

> _“They are what we chose not to be. And yet—we are both survivors.”_

### 🌍 Role in Artumin

In Artumin, orcs serve quietly but impactfully. You’ll find them as:

- Logistics coordinators
- Battle doctrine theorists
- Safety officers within guild halls
- Archive defenders, weapon inspectors, and trauma wardens

They are rarely in charge of a guild, but often trusted with **its foundations**.

**Notable Individual:**  
**[[Porga Brokentusk]]** – Senior strategist within the [[Adventurer’s Guild]]. Former warrior turned procedural architect. Oversees training standards, artifact safety, and internal protocols. Often dismissed by field agents—but held in highest regard by those who understand what failure prevention really means.

### 🔦 Orcstagin & the Divine

Most Orcstagin see the gods not as masters, but as **forces to measure oneself against**.

- **The Restraint** – An unnamed ideal of total control; not a god, but a philosophical presence.
- **[[Tamaral]]** – Goddess of earned understanding. Popular among scholar-orcs, forge-keepers, and logistical planners.
- **[[Gorm]]** – The Warfather. Honored in tradition, but viewed as an incomplete being—powerful, yet not fully tempered.
- **[[Jopli]]** – God of mercy and endings. Revered by elders and post-war caretakers.

They **reject ecstatic worship**, preferring prayer through action. A well-executed drill. A promise kept. A held temper.
