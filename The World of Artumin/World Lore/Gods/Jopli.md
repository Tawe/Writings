### 🕯️ **Core Tenets**

1. **Every journey must end. Help others find the way.**  
    The faithful guide travelers, mourners, and the dying with humility and care. To walk beside another in their final steps is a sacred trust.
2. **Do not hasten the end—but do not fear it.**  
    Death is not a failure but a passage. It must not be rushed, but neither should it be denied when it arrives.
3. **Keep the lantern lit.**  
    To remember the fallen, preserve stories, and mark the way for those who follow is to honor the sacred duty of the living.
4. **Mercy is the truest map.**  
    In judgment and survival, choose compassion. A safe road offered to another is a prayer in action.
