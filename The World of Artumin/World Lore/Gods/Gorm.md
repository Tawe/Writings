### 🔥 **Core Tenets**

1. **Strength earns respect, but discipline earns legacy.**  
    Gorm’s followers are expected to fight with clarity, control, and purpose—not rage or cruelty.
2. **The shield is as sacred as the blade.**  
    Protecting others is as honored as vanquishing enemies. Gorm honors those who stand their ground.
3. **Loyalty is a battlefield oath.**  
    Those who abandon their comrades are seen as worse than cowards—they are oathbreakers.
4. **Victory is not dominance, but survival with honor.**  
    War is a forge, not a theater. Gorm detests unnecessary cruelty, looting, or showmanship.
