### 🏔️ **Temples and Shrines**

- Shrines are often **built from battlefield salvage**—swords, helmets, and stones gathered from the fallen.
- A Gormite temple might contain:
    - A **wall of names**—not of victors, but of those who stood and held.

### 🌱 **Core Tenets**

1. **Life seeks balance. Aid its rhythm.**  
    Growth is not endless—there must be rest, decay, and return. Healing means restoring what is natural, not forcing perfection.
