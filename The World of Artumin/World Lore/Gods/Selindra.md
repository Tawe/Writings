### 🌱 **Core Tenets**

1. **Life seeks balance. Aid its rhythm.**  
    Growth is not endless—there must be rest, decay, and return. Healing means restoring what is natural, not forcing perfection.
2. **Mend before you destroy. Shelter before you strike.**  
    Her followers believe in defense, nourishment, and sustainability over conflict—though they will fight to protect the sanctity of life.
3. **All things are sacred in their time.**  
    Weeds, predators, and rot have their place. Judgment must come with humility.
4. **Your hands are the Green Mother's voice.**  
    Actions matter more than words. To tend, to feed, to heal—these are prayers.
