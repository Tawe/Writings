### 🛡️ **General Profile**

- Provides **trained navigators, terrain specialists, and survival experts** to other guilds, trade costers, and expeditions across Artumin.
- Their members are **certified**—each graduate of the guild undergoes rigorous trials in **wayfinding, shelter logic, and storm response**.
- Valued for their **technical skill**, but viewed by some as **lacking consistency**—reputation varies sharply based on individual performance.    
- Most wanderers travel solo; they’re rarely embedded long-term with the same group, leading to **limited personal trust** in field deployments.

---

### ⚔️ **Philosophy & Internal Culture**

- Founded on the principle that **the path must always be found**—even when maps fail or old roads collapse.
- Encourages **adaptive thinking, self-reliance, and improvisation** under pressure.
- Disfavors hierarchy in the field; wanderers are expected to rely on their own judgment, not chain-of-command deference.
- Culture can appear **odd or idiosyncratic** to outsiders—many members develop unique communication habits, superstitions, or styles.
