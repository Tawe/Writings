**Alias(es):** The Brotherhood, City Watch, The Crest  
**Guild Tier:** Minor Guild (Traditional Influence, Fading Prominence)  
**Headquarters:** The Brotherhood Keep, South Ward, Artumin  
**Motto:** “To Stand. To Shield. To Endure.”

### 🧭 Overview

The Honorable Brotherhood is one of the oldest structured defense guilds in [[Artumin]], responsible for **city watch rotation, noble bodyguard assignments, and the protection of key civic sites**. Once held in high esteem, the Brotherhood now finds itself challenged by a changing world: newer guilds offer flashier services, more lucrative contracts, and flexible staffing models.

Despite its diminished status, the Brotherhood maintains a strong internal culture of discipline, uniformity, and ethical duty. To wear the crest is to represent the safety and stability of the city itself.

### 🎯 Core Functions

- Provides **trained, uniformed watchmen** to patrol city districts
- Assigns **licensed bodyguards** to noble houses, visiting dignitaries, and guildmasters
- Secures **critical infrastructure**, including vaults, council chambers, and ceremonial halls
- Administers **standardized training, drills, and conduct codes**

---

### 🛠️ Values & Philosophy

- **Uniformity over flair** – All members wear regulation armor and follow codified conduct.
- **Discipline over instinct** – Members are trained to follow protocol, not improvise.
- **Guardianship over glory** – Unlike the [[Adventurer's Guild]], the Brotherhood does not seek recognition, only results.

### 🧱 Structure

- **Captain of Procurement (e.g., [[Nora Greyhelm]]):** Oversees armament, supplies, and innovation proposals
- **Council of Stewards:** Senior officers representing each city district and specialty (bodyguard, ceremonial, logistics)
- **Lieutenants (e.g., [[William Book]]):** Operational leads on training, assignments, and implementation of new initiatives
- **The Line:** Common watchmen, gatekeepers, and rotating detail squads

---

### ⚖️ Political Standing

- Once aligned closely with the High Stewards, now **competing with the [[Adventurer's Guild]]** for staffing and relevance.
- **Not formally endangered**, but under increasing scrutiny for lack of modernization and recruitment attrition.

### 🧾 Current Challenges

- Declining enrollment and **brain drain to more flexible guilds**
- Budget constraints and **difficulty justifying innovation spend**
- Internal friction between **traditionalists and reformers**
- Rumors that **northern watch duties may be outsourced** to the [[Adventurer's Guild]]]
