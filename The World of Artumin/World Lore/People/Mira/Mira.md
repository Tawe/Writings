### 🔍 Symbolism

Mira embodies the archetype of:

> The **quiet tactician**—the one who sees the future not to dominate it, but to protect others from its worst angles.

Her story invites reflection on undervalued types of leadership:

- What happens when the one who **sees ahead** is no longer there to guide?
- Do we measure worth by what someone **achieved**, or what they **prevented**?
- How do we honor voices that **warned wisely but died unheard**?

Mira’s death was sudden—but not without pattern. In the echoes of her last spell, the [[Ravenguard]] still wonders whether the final warning was for them… or for what might come next.
