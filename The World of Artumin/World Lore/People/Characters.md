- Knows [[Cora of the Wheel|Cora]]’s record and her trauma make her trustworthy—but also sees how that trauma may limit her openness.

He challenges common metrics of advancement by prompting questions like:

- How do we measure **resilience** and **moral steadiness** in a world that celebrates charisma?
- Do we only reward those who lead from the front—or also those who **hold the center** when others fracture?
- What does leadership look like when it’s silent, stabilizing, and shaped like stone?

## **Bakler Underbite**  

**Role:** Senior member of the [[Ravenguard]]; primary healer, logistics voice, and moral realist of the group  
**Race:** **Hobgoblin**  
**Age:** 39  
**Class/Profession:** **Cleric of [[Jopli]]** — god of safe journeys, weary lanternlight, and the long road home. His domain is **Gravemark and Shelter**: protection, rest, and the wisdom to stop when the map runs red.  
**Faith:** Devout, but quietly so. Prays without spectacle. Views the divine as **a burden to be honored**, not a gift to be flaunted.  
**Appearance:** Lean and hardened, with ash-smeared chainmail and heavy eyes. Red skin faded to rust, yellow eyes sharp but sunken from sleepless nights. Always looks like he’s preparing to say no—and sometimes says yes anyway.  
**Reputation:** Known for **grim honesty and unflinching assessments**. Not loved by every teammate, but almost always trusted. Keeps the books, the bandages, and the boundary lines.  
**Appears in:** [[The Threshold – An Examination of Cost]] 

---

### 🧠 Personality & Strengths

---

### 📊 Position in the Bonus Dispute

- Not submitted for formal rank elevation, though informally recognized as the Ravenguard’s “second mind.”
- [[Sepora Duskblade|Sepora]] has argued that Bakler **“keeps the fire burning”**—without him, their group wouldn’t survive winters, let alone dungeons.
- [[Avrous Detro|Avrous]] described Bakler as **“the one who pays the emotional tax”**—the first to feel guilt, the last to show it.
    

---

### 🔍 Symbolism

Bakler represents a crucial, often undervalued role in adventuring parties and organizations alike:

> The **emotional accountant and internal critic**—the one who counts the real cost, not just the gold.

He raises vital questions in leadership and recognition:

- How do we reward those who **see the cracks coming** before they form?
- Is realism cynicism—or is it what keeps the rest of the team alive?
- What does it mean to **serve the mission** by questioning it?

Bakler doesn’t shine. He doesn’t sell. But he makes sure no one forgets what’s already been lost.

---

### 📊 Position in the Bonus Dispute

- Nominated by [[Hillcrack the Mighty|Hillcrack]] for **Field Merit Recognition**, citing Avrous’s stabilizing presence during mission collapse.
- [[Bakler Underbite|Bakler]] countered that Avrous held the team together after [[Mira]]’s death, and that his decisions **“prevented a third cloak on the floor.”**
- [[Sepora Duskblade|Sepora]] privately acknowledges she has leaned more heavily on Avrous than she intended, and credits him for bringing both clarity and conscience to the Ravenguard’s darkest hour.

---

### 🔍 Symbolism

Avrous embodies the often misunderstood archetype of:

> The **emerging leader**—still unproven, but rising in the fire.

He prompts reflection on questions relevant to many organizations and teams:

- When does **emotional labor** count as leadership?
- How do we evaluate those who **don’t command**, but **connect**?
- Is legacy earned through victory—or **through how one carries loss**?

Avrous doesn’t know all the answers. But in the shadow of grief and unfinished stories, he’s beginning to ask the right questions—and that, too, is a kind of leadership.

**Class/Profession:** **Paladin (Oath of the Hearthfire)** — a rare oath focused on guardianship, protection of kin, and enduring through hardship rather than conquest

---

### 🔍 Symbolism

Tannen represents one of the oldest and most respected adventuring archetypes:

> The **guardian who doesn’t chase glory—only ensures others reach it.**

He prompts deep reflection on sacrifice and recognition:

- Do we **reward those who lead from behind**—who carry shields instead of speeches?
- When someone dies fulfilling their role, is that success—or the greatest failure?
- How do we **honor the quiet pillars**, when their story ends before the final act?

Tannen may never claim glory. But the path to it was paved with his final breath. And that, too, is legacy.

---

### 🔍 Symbolism

Mira embodies the archetype of:

> The **quiet tactician**—the one who sees the future not to dominate it, but to protect others from its worst angles.

Her story invites reflection on undervalued types of leadership:

- What happens when the one who **sees ahead** is no longer there to guide?
- Do we measure worth by what someone **achieved**, or what they **prevented**?
- How do we honor voices that **warned wisely but died unheard**?

Mira’s death was sudden—but not without pattern. In the echoes of her last spell, the [[Ravenguard]] still wonders whether the final warning was for them… or for what might come next.

## **The Skeleton King**  
**Role:** Undead sovereign and primary target of the [[Ravenguard]]'s high-tier Guild contract  
**Race:** Once Human (now Undead Sovereign)  
**Age:** Unknown; believed to have ruled in the **Age Before Rot**, centuries before current reckoning  
**Class/Profession:** **Lich-King / Deathlord** — master of necrotic forces and sovereign of the sealed crypt realm. Combines arcane power, battlefield command, and an ancient pact with the realm of decay  
**Faith:** 
**Appearance:** Towering skeletal figure clad in ceremonial armor of gold and obsidian, inscribed with long-dead sigils. His crown is fused with his skull, and his eye sockets burn with unwavering violet flame.  
**Reputation:** The **central legend of the Sceptre’s fall**—once a ruler of peace, now a tyrant of death. Believed to **anchor the necrotic field** corrupting his crypt, binding the dead and denying rest to intruders.  
**Appears in:** [[The Threshold – An Examination of Cost]] (Antagonist, Offscreen)

---

### 🧠 Personality & Strengths

- Unseen in the story, but looms like a curse
- Presumed to be ancient, calculating, and **intimately aware of intruders** via necromantic tether
- His presence warps the tomb, animates the fallen, and **ensnares souls** caught within
- Notably has not left his crypt in recorded memory—his power is **territorial, defensive, and symbolic**
- **Possibly bound** to the Sceptre of Radiance itself, or to the glyph-sealed gates of his throne chamber

---

### 📊 Position in the Bonus Dispute

- Contract issued by the Guild of [[Artumin]] identified the Skeleton King as both **a target** and **a field condition**—his destruction marked as the “release vector” for the necrotic curse
- [[Sepora Duskblade|Sepora]] believed eliminating him would collapse the aura and create a clean extraction route
- [[Mira]] identified glyph patterns suggesting **the crypt was not built to contain him—but to house him**
- Guild historians remain divided: some view the Skeleton King as **a corrupted monarch**, others as **a martyr left behind** to guard something worse
    

---

### 🔍 Symbolism

The Skeleton King represents a powerful archetype:

> The **ruined ideal**—a once-great figure twisted into the final obstacle.

He stands as a mirror to the [[Ravenguard]]’s journey:

- He was a king who sought peace—and lost everything defending it
- He was powerful—but **buried for it**
- He chose duty beyond death—and became the thing others must destroy to survive

To confront him is to confront the cost of legacy gone too far. The question isn’t whether the Ravenguard can defeat him.

The question is whether they’ll become him.
