### 🧭 Description:

Captain Nora Greyhelm is a battle-tested officer who carries herself with quiet authority.

Nora speaks in short, direct sentences. She rarely raises her voice, but when she does, it commands silence. Her praise is rare—but when given, it carries enormous weight. She will challenge carelessness and insubordination immediately, but she does so with the authority of a builder, not a breaker.
