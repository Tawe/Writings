### 🔍 Symbolism

Avrous embodies the often misunderstood archetype of:

> The **emerging leader**—still unproven, but rising in the fire.

He prompts reflection on questions relevant to many organizations and teams:

- When does **emotional labor** count as leadership?
- How do we evaluate those who **don’t command**, but **connect**?
- Is legacy earned through victory—or **through how one carries loss**?

Avrous doesn’t know all the answers. But in the shadow of grief and unfinished stories, he’s beginning to ask the right questions—and that, too, is a kind of leadership.
