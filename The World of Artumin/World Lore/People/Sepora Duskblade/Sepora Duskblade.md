### 📊 Position in the Tomb Dilemma

- Sepora was the **architect of the [[Skeleton King]] contract**, framing it as a high-risk, high-reward move that could elevate the [[Ravenguard]]’s standing
- After the deaths of two teammates, her insistence on continuing is met with internal resistance—particularly from [[Bakler Underbite]]
- Her belief: the goal is within reach, and retreat now would render all sacrifice meaningless
- Her flaw: blinded by sunk cost and personal stake, she underestimates the group’s dwindling capacity

### 🔍 Symbolism

Sepora represents the **visionary operator** in both fantasy and real-world teams:

> The **planner who dares big**, gets buy-in, and leads into danger—but doesn’t always fully own the cost when things fall apart.

She raises enduring questions:

- Is belief in a plan enough to justify the toll?
- Do those who convince others to take risks owe more when those risks turn lethal?
- What separates a bold leader from a reckless one—results, or regret?
