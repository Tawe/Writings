### ⚖️ Position in the Trust Dilemma

- Must choose whether to follow **[[Cora of the Wheel|Cora]]** (a trusted veteran with earned wisdom and scars) or **[[Sarah the Wayfinder|Sarah]]** (a quirky but focused newcomer with unproven reliability).
- Knows [[Cora of the Wheel|Cora]]’s record and her trauma make her trustworthy—but also sees how that trauma may limit her openness.
- Sees something in [[Sarah the Wayfinder|Sarah]] when the storm hits: a shift from bravado to clarity, the kind of instinct that _can’t be taught_.
- Weighs **[[Jacob Nightfeather|Jacob]]’s measured endorsement** of [[Sarah the Wayfinder|Sarah]] heavily; [[Jacob Nightfeather|Jacob]] has been right before, including about [[Cora of the Wheel|Cora]].
- Ultimately must choose between **what has worked before** and **what might work now**, knowing the storm (both literal and social) won’t wait.

### 🌩️ Symbolism

Argus represents a specific kind of leadership archetype:

> The **experienced, emotionally burdened decision-maker** caught between legacy and potential.  
> His role provokes questions such as:

- How do we evaluate risk when people are the unknown variable?
- Is trust something earned by record—or given as a belief in who someone could become?
- What do leaders owe their teams when certainty isn’t possible?
