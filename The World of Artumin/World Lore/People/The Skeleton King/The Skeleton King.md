- [[Sepora Duskblade|Sepora]] believed eliminating him would collapse the aura and create a clean extraction route
- [[Mira]] identified glyph patterns suggesting **the crypt was not built to contain him—but to house him**
- Guild historians remain divided: some view the Skeleton King as **a corrupted monarch**, others as **a martyr left behind** to guard something worse

### 🔍 Symbolism

The Skeleton King represents a powerful archetype:

> The **ruined ideal**—a once-great figure twisted into the final obstacle.

He stands as a mirror to the [[Ravenguard]]’s journey:

- He was a king who sought peace—and lost everything defending it
- He was powerful—but **buried for it**
- He chose duty beyond death—and became the thing others must destroy to survive

To confront him is to confront the cost of legacy gone too far. The question isn’t whether the Ravenguard can defeat him.

The question is whether they’ll become him.
