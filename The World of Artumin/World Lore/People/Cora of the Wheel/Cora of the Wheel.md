### 🧠 Personality & Strengths

- **Disciplined, unsentimental, and sharp-eyed.** She doesn’t miss much, and rarely offers her opinion unless it’s founded in hard-earned experience.
- Has survived ambushes, storms, poor leadership, and worse—those scars have made her both skeptical and indispensable.
- Holds others to high standards because she holds herself to even higher ones.
- Speaks plainly and with conviction; rarely hedges, and often assumes responsibility for others' oversights.
- **Believes in earned trust** above all—and bears a low tolerance for untested individuals in moments of real risk.

### ⚖️ Position in the Trust Dilemma

- Represents the philosophy that **“trust must be earned”**—grounded in the loss of a former protégé she vouched for who died due to poor judgment.
- Sees [[Sarah the Wayfinder|Sarah]] not as a threat, but as an unnecessary variable—someone who hasn’t proven herself and carries too much uncertainty.
- Offers an alternative route to the watchtower: slower but known. Her position is not rigid for its own sake—it’s protective. It’s the route where she knows she can keep people alive.
- Pushes back on [[Argus Leyline|Argus]] not to undermine him, but to anchor him in precedent and real-world consequence.

### 🔍 Symbolism

Cora represents a leadership archetype found in both fantasy and real-world organizations:

> The **trusted execution expert** whose trauma makes them cautious to the point of inflexibility.  
> Her presence challenges questions like:

- What happens when proven judgment becomes resistant to change?
- How do we respect experience while leaving room for emergence?
- Is protecting others the same as empowering them?
