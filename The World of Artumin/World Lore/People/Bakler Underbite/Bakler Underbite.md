**Role:** Senior member of the [[Ravenguard]]; primary healer, logistics voice, and moral realist of the group  
**Race:** **Hobgoblin**  
**Age:** 39  
**Class/Profession:** **Cleric of [[Jopli]]** — god of safe journeys, weary lanternlight, and the long road home. His domain is **Gravemark and Shelter**: protection, rest, and the wisdom to stop when the map runs red.  
**Faith:** Devout, but quietly so. Prays without spectacle. Views the divine as **a burden to be honored**, not a gift to be flaunted.  
**Appearance:** Lean and hardened, with ash-smeared chainmail and heavy eyes. Red skin faded to rust, yellow eyes sharp but sunken from sleepless nights. Always looks like he’s preparing to say no—and sometimes says yes anyway.  
**Reputation:** Known for **grim honesty and unflinching assessments**. Not loved by every teammate, but almost always trusted. Keeps the books, the bandages, and the boundary lines.  
**Appears in:** [[The Threshold – An Examination of Cost]]

### 🔍 Symbolism

Bakler represents a crucial, often undervalued role in adventuring parties and organizations alike:

> The **emotional accountant and internal critic**—the one who counts the real cost, not just the gold.

He raises vital questions in leadership and recognition:

- How do we reward those who **see the cracks coming** before they form?
- Is realism cynicism—or is it what keeps the rest of the team alive?
- What does it mean to **serve the mission** by questioning it?

Bakler doesn’t shine. He doesn’t sell. But he makes sure no one forgets what’s already been lost.
