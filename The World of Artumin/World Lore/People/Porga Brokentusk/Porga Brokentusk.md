### 🛠️ Responsibilities within the Guild

- No longer adventuring in the field; serves in a **foundational, behind-the-scenes role** that impacts nearly every active member indirectly.
- **Develops training standards** for new recruits and veteran companies alike.
- **Establishes operating procedures** (SOPs) for Guild missions, safety, and evaluation.
- **Studies mysterious artifacts** to ensure they are safe or understood before being distributed.
- His work is **not tied to revenue**—he doesn’t slay monsters or retrieve treasure—but **prevents disaster** and **multiplies the value of others**.

---

### 🧠 Personality & Reputation

- Steady, methodical, and respected by those who understand what he does.
- May be under-appreciated by field adventurers or performance-focused captains.
- Seen by [[Jefferson Blacksword|Jefferson]] as a model of **“impact without visibility.”**
- **[[Garret Ironeye|Garret]], in contrast, dismisses his contributions** as administrative or academic: “Porga’s not bleeding in some ruin while [[Felia of the Green Eye|Felia]] holds the line.”

### 🔍 Symbolism

Porga represents **infrastructure and institutional wisdom**—the often invisible work that keeps an organization from crumbling.  
In modern terms, he’s the **staff engineer, QA architect, or enablement lead**—vital, but not splashy.

His presence asks:

- Do we only reward those on the frontlines?
- How do we recognize people who **prevent** problems rather than respond to them?
