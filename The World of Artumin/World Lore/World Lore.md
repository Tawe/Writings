### ✨ Other Known Guild Members

- **Felia of the Green Eye**: Elf cleric of **Selindra, the Green Mother**. Highly dependable but not visible in mentorship or outreach. Garret's most trusted member.
- **Darvin W’teh**: Human practitioner of **true name magic**. Skilled and accurate but isolated—lacks leadership traits or relational trust.
- **Porga Brokentusk**: Veteran orc turned Guild administrator. Develops safety protocols, training standards, and artifact evaluation processes. A “quiet cornerstone” of the Guild, not tied to direct revenue.
