## Where Worth Lies - An Examination of Value


The candles had long since burned to nubs, and still the papers lay scattered across the desk like bones picked clean. The Adventurer’s Guild—one of the largest minor guilds in the free city of Artumin—had grown fast in recent years, and whispers said it was poised to ascend into the ranks of the city’s eight major guilds. That made this year's bonus season all the more scrutinized. These weren’t just payments—they were signals. Markers of who the Guild valued, who might be trusted with more, and who would shape its path if the elevation went through. Jefferson Blacksword, newly appointed Guildmaster, had signed every decision himself. Jefferson Blacksword sat with his hands steepled, the firelight casting long shadows across the old war-scar that crept from his brow to cheek. He wasn't reading anymore—he hadn’t been for some time. He was bracing.

Across from him sat Garret Ironeye, captain of the Stone Horse Company—one of the more seasoned and battle-tested adventuring groups in the Guild’s ranks—stiff-backed and brimming with silent fury. The dwarf’s arms were crossed tightly over his barrel chest, his face a well-weathered anvil of stubbornness. The tension in the room was a coiled crossbow string, tight enough to hum.

"You call that a bonus?" Garret growled, his gravelly voice full of contempt. "A couple silver more than a field cook? Felia’s been with me five years. Never late. Never fails. That _means_ something. You think people like that just appear when it’s convenient?"

Jefferson sighed, fingers brushing the edge of a cracked ledger. "It does. But we evaluate more than reliability, Garret. She’s good, aye. But she’s—"

"Don't you _dare_ say 'good enough.' That’s an insult. She’s the backbone of my company. If she walks, you’ll feel the loss before your ink dries."

Jefferson looked up, the flicker in his eyes harder to place than the firelight’s glow. "You ranked her third out of your company of seven during the last review. Solid, dependable. But she hasn’t stepped up beyond the mission. No mentoring. No outreach. She’s an asset, but she’s not amplifying others."

Garret leaned forward, nostrils flaring. “You sit in this hall of ledgers and scrolls, measuring folk like crates of dried meat. But you don’t _see_ what’s out there. Felia holds that group together. Half the contracts we take? They don’t come back clean without her. You talk about impact like it’s something that can be inked in margins. But how do you _truly_ know what my people give?”

Jefferson paused. The words settled like stone. “That’s fair,” he said, slower this time. “I can’t see everything. I depend on captains like you to surface what’s hidden. That’s part of your charge, too.”

“I _am_ surfacing it,” Garret shot back. “But you’ve got a picture in your head of what leadership looks like, and if someone doesn’t fit it clean, you toss them aside. Darvin’s sharp. He’s cracked wards, lifted curses, solved traps with a glance. But because he doesn’t talk loud or scribble theory in the margins, he’s not good enough for you.”

“I believe you,” Jefferson said. “But belief and accountability aren’t the same.”

He stood and walked to the fire, letting the warmth press against the chill in his skin. “Darvin has skill. No doubt. But I don’t see the thread of leadership. He completes the mission—but he doesn’t lift the Guild with him. If a new hand found trouble, he wouldn’t be the one they turned to. He hasn’t built that trust. He hasn’t earned that weight. And that, to me, speaks volumes.”

Garret scoffed. “My company takes the worst jobs on the board. High-risk, high-blood, high-toll. And now you want us to stop mid-crawl through a bone pit to help some squire who can’t hold their nerve? We don’t have the time—not when we’re carrying the Guild’s contracts on our backs.”

“Not less,” Jefferson said. “But differently.”

“You saw it in Porga Brokentusk,” Garret muttered, voice low and edged. “That orc sits in a stone room all day writing scrolls and setting rules. And you made _him_ a cornerstone?”

“Yes,” Jefferson said without flinching. “Because Porga builds safety. He trains others. Crafts standards. Heads off disaster before it starts. And no one praises him because it never gets bad enough to notice. That’s strength too.”

Garret slammed his fist against the desk. “Porga’s not bleeding in some ruin while Felia holds the line. He’s not the one dragging a half-dead scout out of a collapsing corridor. You’re handing out honors to parchment while my people hold the Guild together with blood and grit.”

“No,” Jefferson said quietly. “I’m rewarding what keeps us standing when the storm comes again.”

But even as he said it, Jefferson felt a pull in his chest. Garret’s fire, his fury—it wasn’t noise. It was care. Deep, stubborn, protective care. The kind of love he used to feel for his own company, the Blackswords. Had he drifted so far from it?

There was a time, Jefferson thought, when quiet skill looked like idleness to him. When he might have overlooked the healer who showed up every day, or the mage who studied alone. He didn’t know if asking for more was wrong. But tonight, he wasn’t sure it was right either.

“Here’s what I’ll offer,” Jefferson said, his voice low. “I’ll revisit Darvin’s promotion in three months. If he shows the kind of impact we’re talking about—guiding others, lifting beyond himself—I’ll sign the order myself.”

Garret raised a skeptical brow.

“But I’ll need your help,” Jefferson continued. “Start logging. Specific actions. Evidence I can stand behind. Not stories—_signs._ Show me something I can trace.”

Garret’s eyes burned. “You want ink to prove a man’s worth. Some of the truest work we do leaves no mark.”

Jefferson nodded. “Then bring me what _can_ be seen. Not perfection. Just a path.”

But even as he said it, a knot twisted in his gut. What if he was wrong? What if all his ledgers and frameworks were missing something vital—something that couldn’t be charted?

He almost said it aloud. Almost.

Garret clenched his jaw, grinding out the words. “You’ll get your trail. But don’t mistake compliance for agreement.”

“I don’t,” Jefferson said. “But I won’t lead blind.”

The silence hung between them like a drawn blade.

Garret turned to leave. At the door, he paused. “You want proof? Fine. I’ll bring it. But I’m not doing it for you. I’m doing it for them.”

The door shut with a heavy _thunk_.

Jefferson poured a bit of brandy. His hand lingered on the bottle, heavier than it should’ve been. Not to dull the edge—but to mark the weight of the night. He sat, surrounded by pages and ghosts.

**What is value, really?**

Was it coin earned? Battles won? Quiet strength? Or something else entirely—something we only noticed after it was gone?

Maybe. Just maybe… doing your duty—and doing it well—_was_ impact.

Could a steady sword arm be greater than the sharpest mind? Could devotion outlast vision? Could love for one’s circle… be the truest kind of leadership?

Somewhere out in Artumin, torches were being lit. Contracts reviewed. Packs checked. Some would bring home riches. Others, hard lessons. And some—if they stayed the course—might shape the Guild itself.

He took a long sip.

“I don’t need heroes,” he whispered to the dark. “I need stewards.”

But as the fire cracked and the shadows stirred, Jefferson knew:

Garret would prove him wrong.

And maybe—just maybe—that was exactly what the Guild needed.

**Author’s Note**  
As a leader, you don’t always find yourself in the day-to-day lives of those you lead. Often, you rely on what’s surfaced through word of mouth, what’s repeated in leadership meetings, or whose name comes up most in your one-on-ones. But what about the others? The people who may not drive a new initiative, or push forward new standards, or mentor others, but who execute their role with excellence and consistency, day in and day out?

This story was born from a moment where I found myself wrestling with that exact question. I realized I might have been undervaluing quiet consistency. I began to wonder—what is impact, really? What kind of value matters most? And what does it mean to be “good enough”? This piece doesn’t offer answers. It’s an invitation to reflect—on what we see, what we measure, and what we might be missing.

## The Blackpowder Decision - An Examination on Adoption of the Cutting Edge


The sun baked the stone yard as Captain Nora Greyhelm stood with arms crossed, eyes narrowed beneath her helm. The sound of crackling echoed sharply as the unfamiliar weapon fired—a sharp crack and recoil, louder than any crossbow. A heartbeat later, the armor-clad dummy fifty paces out snapped backward, its breastplate torn open.

The weapon hadn’t come from Guild stores. William had bought it himself—quietly, out of his personal stipend. No requisition. No signature. Just a long ride east, a modest payment, and the gamble that this time, something would land.

William had pitched other initiatives before—some clever, some costly. A few showed promise. Most did not. Each time, he’d been heard, but never followed.

This time, he brought proof instead of proposals.

Nora watched the target sway, smoke drifting on the hot wind. She said nothing. But her silence, for once, was not disinterest.

She turned, slow and steady, and began walking back toward the Brotherhood’s keep—a squat, stone-walled structure that served as both barracks and bastion. Her boots crunched softly over the packed earth, weaving past target dummies and half-abandoned drill lines. The shadow of the keep stretched long ahead of her, like the weight of the question still unresolved.

Then came footsteps. Fast. Eager. Familiar. His voice arrived before he did—picking up where a dozen old proposals had left off.

"We _have_ to buy them," Lieutenant William Book called, catching up at a jog. His coat flared as he fell into stride beside her.

Nora kept walking. Eyes forward. "We are not in the business of collecting curiosities, Lieutenant."

"That’s not curiosity," he said, breath quick. "That’s leverage. That’s momentum. That’s the first new weapon we’ve been offered in a decade. And it _works_."

"So do swords."

"Not like _that_. You saw the armor. It tore clean through. And it says something. You want recruits? Retention? Give them a reason to believe we're not relics."

They moved past the inner courtyard. Crossbows lined the racks. The drills had quieted. Too hot. Too tired. Too old.

William glanced at her. "You know, I’ve heard it too. Talk in the council hall. They say the Adventurer’s Guild could take over the goblin front. It’s just whispers—but the kind that don’t go away. If that happens, we’re not just trimming scope. We’re gutting the Brotherhood."

Nora’s jaw tightened, but she said nothing.

""Eighteen percent drop in enrollment," William continued. "And the ones we keep? Half of them are looking sideways at the Adventurer’s Guild. They see gold, glory, fancy gear. We offer? Routine. Orders. Salary."

"Stability," she said. "We offer a code."

"And they want to _survive_."

She didn’t respond right away. That word—_survive_—stuck. Not because it was wrong. Because it was too close to right.

Then, quieter: "Tools change tactics. Tactics become doctrine. And doctrine... becomes myth."

She looked toward the keep. "If these weapons don’t deliver, we’ll have sunk coin, time, and trust into something that weakens us. But if they do, and we hesitate too long, we may find ourselves explaining why someone else was ready while we waited.""

A pause.

"Discipline is not inertia. But it _can_ be camouflage for fear. I won’t be ruled by that.""

William’s voice softened. "I know what this place means to you. And I know I’ve missed before. You remember the glue bags. The alloy plate. That training drill that made three veterans sick as recruits. I know I’ve been wrong before, Captain. But this? This isn’t theory. This isn’t a sketch on a board. It tore through plate. It _works_."

He stopped walking just long enough to face her directly. "If this fails, I’ll carry it. But if we do nothing—if we keep waiting for change to get convenient—we’ll already be replaced by the time anyone thinks to ask what we could have done differently."

Nora nodded once—grimly.

"And how will we maintain them? How many quartermasters have the skills—or the time to strip down a blackpowder weapon between shifts? How many field teams can afford to stop training drills to chase misfires?"

She didn’t wait for an answer. And she didn’t expect one—not from William, not really. The last time she’d trusted a supplier’s quote, the replacement spears had arrived warped and short-stocked. The last time she’d approved a rushed training protocol, two Watchmen had lost fingers to a failed gate brace.

"How long will training take? Who writes the manuals? How many hours before a recruit can shoulder one without flinching at the recoil?"

A breath.

"And where does the powder come from? East of the salt road? Smuggled in barrels we can’t inspect? What will a single crate cost once every guild member decides they need thunder at their hip?"

They reached the west arch. Wind off the stone. Smell of iron and sweat. The yard stretched before them, quiet.

Nora stared at the training dummies. Crossbows rested at ease. So did the Watchmen.

"Where do you propose we find the coin for such an investment?"

"I don’t know yet," William admitted. "But I’ll find it. Noble backing. City purse. Quiet donor. Doesn’t matter. What matters is we _act_."

She said nothing. Just stared. Beyond the arch, a young recruit sat in the shade cleaning a crossbow string already frayed at the nock. She wasn’t meant to notice, but she always did.

She remembered delays: ravine towers held in review until twelve Watchmen never came home. And the mage-lanterns? Rushed into use. Three injuries, one lost hand. That call had been hers.

She imagined a future where recruits lined up—not for matching armor, but for something that might keep them alive. And a different one, where they clung too long to certainty and watched the world pass them by.

She thought of the senior stewards—those who praised stability, who saw the danger of change but not the risk of stagnation. Who read numbers, not winds.

'One day,' she thought, 'someone will ask how we vanished. And they’ll find a ledger. Columns neat. No alarm raised. Until the foundation cracked beneath us.'

"And if we don’t? The Adventurer’s Guild gets there first. They’ll source it themselves. And we’re not just behind—we’re humiliated."

Nora exhaled slowly. Her voice, when it came, was quiet.

"You want us to stake our name on a tool we barely understand."

"No," he said. "I want us to still be standing in five years—with something worth standing for."

Silence.

Then, she paused. The silence stretched.

"This isn’t Guild issue," she said at last. Her tone was colder now, not cautious but clipped. "You misused your stipend. That fund was meant for field contingencies, not for freelance arms deals."

William hesitated. "I didn’t see another way to prove it. If I’d filed the request, it would’ve died in a queue."

"That queue exists for a reason," she snapped. "You’re not a rogue agent, William. You wear the crest. You don’t get to freelance the future without consequences."

She exhaled, then added more quietly, "You’re lucky it worked. Or you'd already be stationed at the northern docks counting barge arrivals."

William didn’t argue. He just nodded, jaw tight.

Then, softer: "I don’t want to leave this place, Captain. But I’m running out of ways to help it survive."

"Just enough for two units and one test firing," he repeated."

Nora’s eyes narrowed. "If that thing had failed in front of command—with recruits watching—it wouldn’t have just been a setback. It would’ve made us look reckless. Desperate. That’s not a risk you take lightly, not with our reputation hanging by a thread."

"Then I’d have stood for it. Publicly. And likely found myself sweeping floors at the eastern signal tower. But it didn’t."

She considered that for a long moment.

"And training? Manuals?"

"Already in draft. I had notes translated from the engineer in Westmarch. If we go forward, I’ll finish it. Personally."

She didn’t reach for the weapon again. Not yet. But her voice shifted—less steel, more stone.

She squinted at him, caught off guard—but only slightly. "And the funding?"

"Give me three days. I’ll find it. Quietly. No compromises."

"If it works," she added, "I’ll take it to the High Stewards myself. But not before. And not without proof."

"One squad. Structured pilot. Maintenance oversight. No public announcements. You fund it—quietly. The rest follows proper channels."

William blinked. Then nodded, fire rekindled.

"Yes, Captain."

Neither of them said it, but both knew: this was only a beginning. A step across a line they’d never be able to unmark.

Nora turned back toward the yard. In the distance, the recruit still worked at the frayed string. The drill master barked a command, but the rhythm was off—an echo of a formation too long unchanged.

"Go."

**Author’s Note**

The Honorable Brotherhood stands at the edge of irrelevance—not for lack of courage, but for its faith in systems that once served well. This story reflects a moment many guilds, teams, or tech leads face: when the old tools still function, but the world has shifted beneath them.

Nora is the leader who’s seen what hasty change can cost. William is the report who’s run out of sanctioned ways to make things better. Their disagreement isn’t fire—it’s weight. Risk on one side. Irrelevance on the other.

This isn’t a story that tells you when to jump on a new technology. It’s a story that asks: how do you _know_? How do you tell the difference between a lasting shift and a passing trend? Between prudent skepticism and fear wearing armor?

I wrote this because I’ve been in Nora’s seat—responsible for something that still technically works. And I’ve been William too—trying to prove a change that felt obvious, but wasn’t safe.

There’s no clean answer. Only tension. Only tradeoffs. Only trust.

And if we’re lucky—someone willing to listen before the foundation cracks.

## The Storm and the Ledger – An Examination of Trust
Thunder rolled across a bruised sky as the wind tugged at the oilskin flaps of Argus Leyline’s saddlebag. He sat motionless atop his mount, watching the horizon crack and boil. Somewhere out there—east, maybe north—was shelter. The wagons behind him groaned beneath crates of alchemical goods and sealed grain. They could not afford to tip, to drown, or to be late.

They waited on him. Every second of silence was a decision deferred. He could feel the weight of it across his chest—more pressing than the storm itself.

A mistake wouldn’t just cost him cargo.

It would cost him belief.

---

Sarah the Wayfinder wasn’t even their usual guide. Brenn had come down sick two nights before departure, and the Wanderer's Guild had sent Sarah, in his place. Certified, yes. But unfamiliar. And in the grasslands, unfamiliar bled quickly into risk.

She’d been confident from the beginning—too confident. Joking about getting lost, about starving in the tallgrass before they’d even passed the first mile marker. Her humor chipped at patience like wind on stone, especially among the veterans. To Argus, it had marked her as someone trying too hard to belong. Still, she’d navigated well enough. No critical missteps—just enough small ones to matter now that the stakes had changed.

But when the sky darkened and the storm took shape, Sarah changed. The jokes fell away. Her stance tightened. Her voice turned firm. No more smiles—just sharp attention.

And that shift—that sudden focus—made Argus pause. It wasn’t confidence now. It was clarity. The kind he’d learned to trust over the years, buried in the eyes of people who’d stopped performing and started surviving. He’d seen that look in Cora once, long ago, right before she led them out of a sandstorm with a broken compass and a bruised leg. That memory flickered in him now, unbidden. And for a moment, he wondered if he was looking at the same steel—only younger, unproven, but no less real.

She told him the storm would catch them—fast and full of teeth. That they needed shelter. That a cave lay tucked past the ridge, marked by a pine with a hook-nose bend. When he asked if she was sure, she only shrugged.

Not dismissive—familiar.

Like someone who had been doubted before. And knew the only way to silence doubt was to survive it.

---

Cora had voiced her concerns the night before, her voice low beside the fire. She hadn’t trusted Sarah from the beginning. Not just because of the jokes. It was the misused terms. The cues she missed. The way she filled silence when she should have been listening.

Cora had always been hard on newcomers. Argus knew that. She had a way of thinking she could do everyone’s job better. And maybe sometimes she could. But she’d been with him from the start—through storms, ambushes, lean winters. She’d bled for the company. Her instincts had kept them alive more times than he could count.

He trusted her. But he also knew she expected too much from those who hadn’t yet had the chance to prove anything at all. It was part of what made her valuable—her standards kept the whole outfit sharp. But it was also a liability. She saw the cracks before the shape. Sometimes, Argus thought, she needed someone to have already survived the fire before she believed they could walk through it. That kind of thinking kept you safe. It also kept people small.

Sarah hadn’t done herself any favors. But maybe she hadn’t been given a fair shot either. Argus remembered earlier that morning—when she'd offered to help with the rear wagon's load shift, only to be waved off by one of the older handlers. Not her job, they’d said. She hadn’t pushed. Just nodded and stepped back. But he’d seen the way her jaw tightened. The moment passed, unnoticed by most. But Argus remembered it now.

Cora remembered how Brenn had earned his place: a bandit ambush turned by quick thinking, a shortcut carved through bramble that saved days, a winter crossing without a single broken axle. He had proven himself in moments that mattered.

Sarah, so far, had only proven that she wasn’t him. Not yet.

It wasn’t the map that bothered Cora—it was the way Sarah held it. Casually. As if knowing the path was enough to survive it.

Cora’s alternative was clear: the watchtower. Old. Cracked. But known. It had weathered storms before—its walls stone, its footing high. Not comfortable, but dependable. It would take time to reach, and they might lose a wagon in the slog, but once inside, they'd likely be safe. The cave? Unmarked. Unmapped. If it wasn’t there—or wasn’t big enough—they’d be caught in the open. Cora’s voice hadn’t argued. It had warned.

He trusted her. But her trust came carved in scar. Years ago, she’d vouched for a young outrider who misread the sky. They buried the man and burned the wagon. She never spoke his name again.

Since then, she demanded more than credentials. She wanted proof. Not promise.

---

Then there was Jacob. Older than he looked. Sharper than most gave him credit for. He had been with the caravan long enough to matter, and long enough to see through charm. It was his eye for talent that had helped shape the crew Argus relied on—including Cora. Years ago, it was Jacob who'd insisted they take a chance on her, back when her scars were still fresh and her tone still sharper than her aim.

He didn’t speak much. But when he did, Argus listened. Not because Jacob was loud—but because he was usually right.

So when Jacob backed Sarah, Argus paid attention. Not just because it was Jacob—but because it stood in stark contrast to Cora’s rejection. She wanted proof carved in certainty. He saw potential waiting to emerge. And in that split, Argus saw the real dilemma—not between cave or ruin, but between what had already been proven and what might, if given space, still rise to meet the storm.

Not blindly. Not casually. Jacob had watched Sarah the whole trip. Observed, not indulged. He didn’t dismiss her missteps—but he saw something beneath them. A steadiness that came forward when it mattered. An edge of competence beneath the clumsy veneer.

“She’s not Brenn,” Jacob had said. “But that doesn’t make her wrong.”

“Sometimes the only map you get is a person,” he had said.

Argus had let that line sit. Let it haunt him.

He wanted to believe that was true.

But he knew what it meant if it wasn’t.

---

The sky cracked again, closer now. Rain stabbed like knives, sharp enough to tear thought from flesh.

Argus blinked, pulled from the mire of memory. His fingers ached around the reins.

They were all watching him. Waiting.

Argus felt it in his chest first—the dull tightening, like a strap drawn slowly across his ribs. His fingers flexed once on the reins, slick with rain and hesitation. A dozen decisions behind him, and still this one felt heavier. He glanced toward the ridge, then east, then back again, each direction an accusation.

For a moment, he wished someone else would speak. Cora. Jacob. Even Sarah. But no one did.

They had made their cases. Now the silence was his.

Cora with a clenched jaw. Sarah with quiet defiance. Jacob with something close to hope.

“Where are we going, Argus?” Cora’s voice was taut. Not challenging. Just tired. Just done waiting.

Sarah said nothing at first. Then, after a breath: “The cave is close.”

No embellishment. No grin. Just a truth she carried, whether they accepted it or not.

He looked at them. The storm around them. The wagons behind.

Sarah hadn’t earned trust. But she hadn’t broken it, either.

Cora had certainty. But only in things already proven.

And Argus—he had to choose between what had worked before and what might work now.

He remembered when he had been the one no one trusted. When someone had handed him a map and said, “Lead.” And someone had believed in him long enough for him to become the man now tasked with deciding.

He didn’t know what the right call was. And that was what truly unsettled him—not the weight of the choice itself, but what it would reveal if he got it wrong. What it would cost. Not just in cargo, or time. But in how they looked at him afterward. In whether Cora’s silence turned to distance, or Jacob’s faith to regret.

The wind screamed past his ears, carrying grit and rain that stung his cheeks. Somewhere behind him, a wagon creaked against the wind, canvas snapping like a reprimand. No one spoke. Even the oxen had gone still.

He wasn’t afraid to be wrong.

He was afraid to lose the trust he still had.

But someone had to make one.

He made the call.

---

Rain swallowed the trail.

Whether they crested the ridge and found the cave—or turned east and reached the ruin—he would never speak of it. A wheel groaned somewhere behind him, wood straining under the weight. Sarah adjusted her grip on the reins, just slightly, like she was bracing for something she couldn’t name. Argus didn’t look back. But he felt the shift ripple through them. The choice had been made. The consequences had not yet arrived.

What mattered was the ledger behind his eyes.

And what he chose to write in it.

---

He didn’t look back. Didn’t speak. Just rode—through the wind, through the doubt, into whatever waited.

Some things you measure in coin.

Others, only in hindsight.

---

**Author’s Note**

This story was born from a conversation about leadership—and the quiet judgments we make about who deserves trust. Sometimes it’s easy to say “trust must be earned.” Other times, we trust because we need to believe in the systems that placed someone at our side. I’ve seen both instincts play out: the wary veteran who’s been burned before, and the idealist who believes that faith given early can change everything.

What struck me, though, was how both approaches carry their own kind of risk. Give trust too easily, and you may invite harm. Withhold it too long, and you might strangle the very growth you seek. One gambles on history; the other on potential. Both are dangerous. Both are necessary.

Cora is right: trust without evidence can cost you lives. But Sarah isn’t wrong either: someone has to go first. Someone has to trust before the map is made.

And in leadership—especially under pressure—choosing one over the other is rarely about principle. It’s about timing, urgency, and how much you’re willing to lose.

There’s no clear answer here. Only storms, choices, and the ledgers we keep after the fact—where every entry says as much about who we are as what we chose.

## The Threshold – An Examination of Cost

The torch burned low, flickering against stone walls slick with moisture. The scent of mildew and burnt marrow clung to the air, and the distant drip of water echoed like a countdown in the dark. In a ruined side chamber deep within the Skeleton King’s crypt, four members of the Ravenguard sat surrounded by the silence of death—and the weight of decision.

They hadn’t come here on a whim.

The Ravenguard were not legends, not innovators, not stars. They were dependable. Cautious. A solid adventuring company known for completing what they started and never reaching beyond their grasp. For years they took safe contracts—pest removals, bandit culls, relic retrievals in low-risk ruins. And slowly, methodically, they built up gold, gear, and confidence.

Then came the posting—Sepora’s idea.

A high-tier Guild contract, one far above their usual scope: enter the tomb of the Skeleton King and retrieve the Sceptre of Radiance. A relic from the age before rot, once held as a symbol of peace before the world turned to ash. Sepora pitched it like a turning point—high risk, yes, but with a reward that could secure their futures. She spoke of reputation, return on investment, and the prestige it would bring. She convinced them it was time to stop playing safe and start building legacy. Dangerous. Prestigious. Rewarded in full guild coin and standing. And the Ravenguard, for the first time, said yes to the deep end.

They stocked to the brim—potions, scrolls, reinforced supplies. Their paladin led the oath. Their diviner, Mira, warned of shifting fates. Their scout plotted three exits. And for a while, it worked. Through sheer grit and cohesion, they pushed deeper than anyone expected.

But the tomb did not care.

Now, two of their number were gone—Tannen, their shield and voice, and Mira, their diviner and seeker of paths in the dark. And the rest? Bruised. Bled. Low on supplies and lower on certainty.

The room had become a war council.

---

Sepora Duskblade, elven rogue, stood with her hands braced against the broken doorframe. Her dark green cloak, once sleek and precise like her movements, was now torn and crusted with ash. A streak of soot cut across one angular cheek, and her once-pristine braid had unraveled into damp curls clinging to her face. Her jaw was tight. She scanned the dim glow of her torchlight like it might offer a sign. One hand trembled until she forced it still. Her words were sharp—but behind them, a breath caught. She had sold this venture, wrapped it in the silk of strategy and confidence, and now watched it unravel thread by thread. If they turned back, it wasn’t just the mission that failed. It was her judgment. Her standing. Her future.

“This is it. All the signs point to it. That barrier? It’s the last one. I can feel it.” Her voice tightened—half certainty, half plea. “We take out the Skeleton King, his necrotic aura collapses, and the dead stop rising. That’s our exit—cleaner than the path we came in.”

She glanced at the floor where Tannen used to stand. Her foot almost stepped into that space before she caught herself and drew back.

“We push forward, we win. And we don’t just win—we retire. This contract’s worth more than every job we’ve taken combined.”

Bakler scoffed, sharp and unfiltered. “This was your plan, Sepora. You sold it with charts and charm. projections, prestige, legacy—you made it all sound easy. But now it’s a bleeding ruin, and you still want us to bet what little’s left like it’s a market swing.”

Bakler Underbite, hobgoblin cleric of Jopli, sat hunched on a cracked stone bench. His battered chainmail bore the soot-stained sigil of a sheltering lantern, the symbol of Jopli, god of safe paths and the light that waits at journey’s end. Its soft glow had long faded. His deep red skin had paled under stress, and the heavy bags under his yellow eyes betrayed nights without rest. He cradled the last of his healing tinctures like brittle glass. His hands shook—he gripped tighter to stop it. He’d already offered two prayers to empty air. Neither brought warmth.

“You’re dreaming,” he said softly. “I’ve got two minor spells left and no sacred oils. Half of us are wounded. Our packs are empty.”

He couldn’t look at the cloaks in the corner. Not at Tannen’s still hands, not at Mira’s silent eyes. He saw them anyway—Mira calling out too late, Tannen shielding Sepora with his last breath.

“If you think that scepter’s worth dying for, ask Mira. Ask Tannen.”

He rubbed his temple, voice cracking. “We head back now, we’ve got a chance. Not a good one, but a real one. We go forward, we’re gambling on a ghost. And if we die down here, the Guild will just post the contract again—and praise whoever follows.”

Hillcrack the Mighty, a Telma barbarian—one of a rare earth-touched people known for their grounded wisdom and stone-like skin—knelt by the wall. His cracked leather armor clung to his massive frame, dusted in grey from the stone’s mourning. His face, broad and flat, bore the faint etchings of natural stone lines, as though carved by time itself. His calloused hand pressed to the cold wall, seeking steadiness. But the earth here… it did not speak. It echoed loss.

He stood slowly, his joints groaning like the floor beneath them. “You argue like it’s still a debate,” he said, voice low but cutting. “We’re not choosing between two good paths. One way ends in bones and questions. The other ends in rot we already know.”

He turned his gaze toward Sepora. “You told us this would be our rise. That we’d make our name here. Maybe you were right. Maybe this is where we carve that name in stone. But stone remembers who stood firm—and who cracked under weight they chose to carry.”

“Our people say the earth gives what it’s ready to take back,” he rumbled. “And this place has taken much. But Sepora’s not wrong. The signs say we’re near. If that’s true…”

His voice, usually a bedrock, trembled. He turned toward the cloaked bodies. “...then maybe finishing this isn’t a matter of profit. Maybe it’s the only way to give them peace.”

Avrous Detro, bard and graduate of the College of Diplomacy and Song, leaned against the wall. His once-immaculate doublet had lost its luster, the embroidered silver thread now dulled with grime. A torn sash hung loosely at his hip. His dark curls were matted with sweat, framing a face too young to have seen this much death. The chill in the room had sunk into his bones, but he dared not shiver. He needed to appear composed—like someone worth following. Fingers white on the flute he hadn’t played since Tannen fell, he held it like a tether to purpose.

He could feel Mira’s voice still in his head—her warnings, her laughter, her hand brushing his arm when no one else looked. He had replayed that last moment—her eyes going wide, mouth starting to form a spell—countless times in the past hours. If he'd been faster. If he'd stood closer. If he'd told her what he meant to.

And now they looked to him.

His voice cracked when it finally came. “You both sound like you’ve already chosen what to bury down here—each other.”

He stepped forward, the iron in his tone now clashing against the room’s weariness. “Sepora, if this is about glory, say so. Say you’d trade their lives for coin and clean exits. Say you’d bury us with them if it meant a story worth telling. Because that’s what it looks like.”

His gaze cut to Bakler. “And you—stop dressing up surrender as wisdom. If you think she’s reckless, say so. Say you think this whole job was a mistake, that we should’ve stayed small. That we were never meant for legacy.”

He stepped forward, between them. “Sepora, you’re right. If we finish this, we live lighter. Stronger. But if we push ahead just to win some ledger war back in Artumin, we’ll lose more than coin.”

His eyes flicked to Bakler. “And you, Bakler—fear doesn’t make you wrong, but don’t hide behind ghosts to avoid making a choice. We all walked into this crypt. We either leave together or we don’t leave at all.”

“We are not six. We are four. And four without a paladin. Four with no food, half a healer, and one plan that ends in a king’s tomb.”

He looked to Sepora, a flicker of guilt behind his even tone. “You’re right—we came for this. Spent months prepping. Stockpiled, studied, waited. But all that prep never included this part—losing half our strength. Watching the frontline fall.”

Then to Bakler. “And you’re right too. We can’t spend what we don’t have. Can’t heal with hope. But turning back means every step forward was wasted. And that’s a kind of death too.”

A memory flickered—Mira, frowning at her readings, her voice hushed but urgent. She had pulled Avrous aside before they descended past the third seal, her finger tracing a spiral on the parchment. "The future bends here," she'd whispered. "It could still break our way." That whisper lingered now, a ghost among the living. As the torch guttered, Avrous could almost hear it again—not in his ears, but behind them. 'It could still break our way,' she had said. He wasn’t sure if it was a promise, a warning, or a lie she needed to believe.

Avrous had loved her—not loudly, not with proclamations or song, but in the way he saved the best parts of himself for her to see. The way he always walked on her side when danger loomed. The way he listened, really listened, when she spoke of stars and symbols and futures that flickered like candleflames. They had made no promises. But in the pause between verses, in the silence between battles, something true had been growing.

Now, all he could do was hold the flute she once teased him about—too ornate, she said, for someone who played it like a prayer—and try to breathe through the ache she left behind.

He took a breath. “What’s left to us now isn’t a clear answer. It’s a cost. A price for staying. A price for going. I don’t think we’ll know which was wiser until years from now—if we live that long.”

---

The silence returned. Not empty, but taut—stretched like a drawn bowstring. A slow drip echoed from somewhere far off, steady as a ticking clock. The stale air turned metallic in their throats. Shadows danced across broken glyphs carved into the walls, and the torch’s flame snapped sideways, as if exhaling something unseen. Stone groaned beneath them. Or something groaned in the stone.

Sepora reached slowly toward her blade but didn’t draw it. Bakler began quietly packing supplies, his movements bitter but methodical. Hillcrack rose from his knees with a grunt like shifting granite. Avrous held his flute to his lips, not to play—but to steady.

And in that silence, the Ravenguard sat with their grief, their dwindling hope, and the knowledge that this wasn’t just a mission anymore.

It was a choice between two unfinished paths—each dangerous, each steeped in consequence.

**Glory lies ahead. Grief behind. Which would you carry?**

**Author’s Note**

Like the Guilds of Artumin, every company faces a moment where momentum and mission part ways. Where survival and success drift just far enough apart to force a choice.

In every leadership room, there comes a moment like this—when the project has run long, the burn rate is high, and the team is down more than they expected. One voice argues to push through, because success is just beyond the last wall. Another warns of collapse, of diminishing returns, of losses that can’t be undone. The rest must weigh momentum against exhaustion.

This story is about that moment. Not when the goal is wrong, or the people are weak—but when the path simply costs more than expected. And no metric, no model, can tell you if the finish line is worth the toll.

There’s no right answer. Only the courage to choose.

## The Keys of Continuance - An Examination of Succession

The forge groaned like a sleeping beast.

Galous Brokenstream stood at the edge of the viewing platform, eyes cast downward to where masterworks cooled in blessed oil and apprentice bellows sang in uneven rhythm. The scent of scorched oil and bitter iron clung to his tongue. Heat licked at his face in waves, the air dry and stinging against his eyes. Every breath was a draw through memory, spiced ash, polished brass, old sweat soaked into aprons long retired.

The viewing platform itself was ringed with the brass reliefs of past Grand Keys. Etched likenesses flanked by their signature mechanisms. Each tile beneath his boots had been laid by a different generation, patterned in the seven-fold spiral of ascension, symbolizing the steps from apprentice to journeyman to master. The tiles whispered underfoot with every shift of weight, an echo of hundreds of boots, hundreds of choices.

The Great Hall of Smiths still hummed, it’s chorus a low, continuous clatter of steel on steel, accented by the hiss of quenching metal and the rhythmic creak of bellows pushed by foot and elbow. Sparks spat upward like fireflies under glass, casting sharp glints along the curved ribs of the arched ceiling. Heat rippled upward through channels in the stone, sending the scent of hot brass, beeswax, and coal dust wafting into every crevice.

Near each forge, ritual hooks held the gloves of masters who had passed, oiled leather gone stiff with age, but never discarded. Over every forge stood a ceremonial warding arch, engraved with the Locksmith’s Oath: “To seal wisely, to open justly, to leave no mark upon what is not mine.”

Three days had passed since Vantus Malgony, Grand Key Molder of the Diligent Order of Locksmiths, had been claimed by a strange fever that warped the tongue and clouded the mind. His death had left the Guild without its master tumbler, and the hall without its true alignment. This was the heart of the Diligent Order of Locksmiths, where each strike of the hammer echoed policy, where mechanisms governed culture as surely as craft governed steel. And above it all, silent yet ever-present, loomed the doctrine of Tamaral the Opener. Goddess of locks and lock-picking, she taught that nothing should yield before it’s understood. The Order did not pray loudly, but each precise cut, each aligned tumbler, was its own kind of worship. Life itself, they believed, was the great lock, and their perfection was the key.

Behind him, the Ringed Council had adjourned, abruptly, bitterly. Without reciting the Lockbinder’s Concord, a tradition that had closed every conclave for over two centuries. Its omission was more than an oversight; it was a breach of ritual harmony, a skipped pin in the mechanism of succession. Six keys lay on the stone altar, ritual replicas forged in the style of the first Guild charter. Three each, split like a cracked lockplate. Galous could almost hear the tension beneath the stillness, as if the keys themselves bristled at the interruption of pattern.

One for Valora Goldwhisper, whose first apprentice pin had been struck in this very hall, who had spent thirty years tuning locks and people with the same steady patience.

One for Jolek P’lot, imported from the trade-city of Cashmei, where locks were born strange and quick-minded, and whose ideas shimmered like quicksilver, too fast for tradition, too new to ignore. He was human by lineage, though rumor in the lower vaults said his blood traced back to something older, wilder. Fey-touched, some whispered, pointing to the way tools bent willingly to his touch or how he always knew which key would fit before it was cut.

Two futures. One chair. No consensus.

And Galous, the seventh, held the final key.

Before he turned it over in his hand, he brought it to the small shrine inset within the stone rail. It was no larger than a palmspan. Just a bronze plate engraved with a spiraling eye, Tamaral’s mark,but tradition held. He pressed the key gently to the metal, bowed his head, and whispered the words passed down since the Guild’s founding: “May what is locked reveal its shape. May what is shaped not shatter.” Only then did he turn it over in his hand.

One side gleamed, etched with flowing runes of the old tongue, each character a known path, a name in the lineage of the Grand Keys before. The other side was jagged. Unset. A lock not yet shaped.

“Still brooding, Galous?” came the gravelly voice of Master Rendin Coilhook. His words landed like dull hammer strikes, slow, deliberate, worn from use. One of the elder councilors, his voice always sounded half-tuned to an older world. His fingers twitched constantly, callused and stained from years of manual work he refused to delegate, even in age. Rendin trusted tools more than words, and history more than hope.

Beside him stood Claina Boltstump, a Kalidor: graceful as tide-slick coral and strange as moon-pulled currents, their lineage whispered of simian roots shaped by sea and surge, every movement a silent echo of wave and foam whose grace moved like tidewater and whose thoughts were never stagnant. Her skin shimmered with hints of deep-sea turquoise, her cheeks set with subtle gill-slits that fluttered softly with breath. Her long, prehensile fingers flicked and curled with constant, purposeful energy, as if orchestrating unseen currents. Even standing still, her body shifted with fluid ease, spine rising and falling in slow rhythmic sways.

“Galous,” she said with clipped precision, her voice crisp as water drawn through copper piping. Her uniform was immaculate. Dark indigo with coral-thread detailing, and her gloves gleamed like fresh sealant. She moved and spoke in surges, insight crashing forward between pauses like tidal breaks. Her mind, famously incisive, had dissected policy drafts like a master unpicking tumblers.

If Rendin was the memory of the Guild’s first locks, Claina was the pattern in the next wave: keen, adaptive, and swift to act before the tide turned against them.

“You know they’ll both try to speak with you again before the next vote,” she said. “And they’ll offer more than words. Jolek’s couriers have already begun whispering of commissions lost to Cashmei, that their pattern-wrights are outpacing ours in both innovation and cost. Valora’s camp has called it fearmongering — but you know as well as I do, the Outer Ring houses are watching this vote with ledgers open, not hearts. The wrong signal, and contracts drift. The right one… and we might hold the trade routes another decade. You’ve got the key, and they’ve got their stories ready.”

Galous didn’t turn. “Let them try.” His voice was quiet, not dismissive, like a tumbler falling into place.

Rendin stepped to the railing, squinting down at the forge. “Vantus would’ve hated this. Not the split. He expected that. But the theatre of it. All this noise around legacy and vision.”

“He thought the Guild should whisper like tumblers,” Claina added. “Not clang like dropped iron.”

Galous turned the undecided key in his palm. “What would he have done?”

“Reminded us that a lock’s only as good as what it protects,” Rendin said.  
“And then left you to stew in it.”

Claina smirked. “He always said you were the Guild’s conscience, Galous. He also said you took too long to speak.”

Galous gave a faint grunt at that. “He said a lot of things.”

They stood in silence, the forge groaning below. Light flickered across the walls in rhythmic waves-iron set to motion, old heat made new again.

Then Rendin stepped back, already withdrawing into himself. “We’ll see you tomorrow. Think with your gut. Not theirs.”

Claina lingered just long enough to say, “Don’t wait for the perfect answer. There isn’t one. But there is a right kind of risk.”

Then she, too, was gone.

One known. One wild.

One forged by duty. One whispered about in back halls and ledger rooms.

Below, the forge fires roared.
