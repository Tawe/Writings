## Why One of the Internet’s Oldest Design Principles Still Matters, and How We Keep Getting It Wrong

_I spent three days debugging a timeout issue that turned out to be our “smart” service mesh retrying failed requests… that were failing because of the retries._

That direct experience reminded me of something I hadn’t thought about in years: the End-to-End Principle. While not every story in this piece is mine, that one was, and it’s what kicked off a deeper reflection on how this principle is still being broken today.

# What Is the End-to-End Principle?

Coined in 1984 by Saltzer, Reed, and Clark, the End-to-End Principle is deceptively simple:

> _“The function in question can completely and correctly be implemented only with the knowledge and help of the application standing at the endpoints of the communication system.”_

In plain English? Keep the middle of your system dumb. Push complexity to the edges. Let the apps decide what needs to happen.

This isn’t just academic. It’s the principle that made the Internet work. TCP/IP doesn’t try to guess your business logic. It just delivers packets. The endpoints figure out the rest.

# How We’re Violating It Today

Modern architectures break this principle all the time:

- API gateways validate JWTs and parse user roles
- Service meshes handle retries, timeouts, and circuit breaking
- Load balancers route based on content, not just endpoints
- Message queues enforce ordering logic
- Databases validate business rules instead of just storing data

Each of these sounds helpful. But they all add complexity where it doesn’t belong.

# Case Study: The Gateway That Got Too Clever

We once had an API gateway that validated JWT tokens, checked user roles, and routed requests based on business logic.

When a new role was introduced by one service, the gateway didn’t recognize it. Suddenly, requests that should’ve succeeded started failing.

No one knew where the logic lived. No one knew who owned the failure. And no one wanted to debug someone else’s config.

The gateway was too smart for its own good.

# Why the End-to-End Principle Still Matters

This isn’t about dogma. It’s about tradeoffs:

- Debuggability: When logic lives at endpoints, you can trace it.
- Flexibility: Teams can evolve independently.
- Resilience: Smart middle layers become shared failure points.
- Performance: Less indirection, fewer hops, cleaner flow.

# Where Should Logic Live? A Practical Framework

If you’re not sure where to place logic, ask these questions:

# Does it require application-specific knowledge?

**Yes** → Push to the **edge**. Only the app knows the full context.

# Will different services or teams need to evolve this independently?

**Yes** → Keep it at the **edge**. Shared logic in the middle slows everyone down.

# Is the function about data delivery, transport, or basic routing?

**Yes** → It’s safe to keep in the **middle**. That’s infrastructure’s job.

# Will debugging this require full visibility into business logic?

**Yes** → Keep it in the **service** that owns that logic.

When in doubt, ask: _Could this decision be made better with full application context?_ If so, don’t push it into infra.

# A Closer Look: Microservices, Platform Drift, and IaC Overreach

This happened to a friend during their platform rebuild, but it’s a familiar story. As he and his team, scaled from a handful of services to several dozen, they introduced shared Terraform modules for standardization: base containers, observability, common retry patterns. Good intentions, good reuse.

But then it crept.

The Terraform modules started encoding app-level circuit breaker policies. Retry behavior. Latency thresholds. Even dependency call logic. Some apps needed aggressive timeouts, others needed long-polling. One-size-fits-all made everyone worse.

Debug time ballooned. Incident frequency rose. At one point, over 40% of incidents involved tracing through shared Terraform modules to find the root cause. And even when they found it? Fixing it meant PRs to a shared module, coordination across teams, and delays in delivery.

They slowly unwound it all. Pushed that logic into service-specific configs. Teams moved faster. Incidents dropped. Debug time fell by 60% over six months. Mean time to resolution (MTTR) improved by nearly 50% in that same window.

Lesson: what starts as helpful standardization can quickly evolve into a brittle, centralized bottleneck if you don’t apply the end-to-end lens.

# A Concrete Pattern That Works

Contrast that with a recent approach we took for request tracing. Instead of building centralized observability logic into the service mesh, we provided a lightweight tracing library that each service imported and configured with its own needs. The library handled the mechanics — span creation, correlation IDs, log injection — but all the context decisions (like what to trace, what to sample, and how to tag events) stayed in the services.

The result? Each team had autonomy to tailor tracing to their flow, and debugging became dramatically easier. Central tooling could still collect and visualize, but the intelligence stayed local. That’s what the end-to-end principle looks like when it works: smart edges, simple pipes.

# The Real Problem: Invisible Complexity

We keep adding layers because we want to help developers. We build smart infra so apps don’t have to think. But that logic doesn’t disappear. It just gets buried deeper.

Then the edge teams move faster. The infra team slows down. And when something breaks, everyone stares at each other.

Sound familiar?

# Cultural and Organizational Forces at Play

We also can’t ignore the organizational gravity that pulls complexity into the middle:

- Desire for control: Platform teams want to ensure consistency and compliance.
- Pressure to reduce developer burden: Infra teams aim to simplify onboarding, setup, and security.
- Org structure mismatch: Conway’s Law means shared tooling often reflects leadership silos more than service boundaries.
- Fear of decentralization: Distributing logic means distributing risk, something many orgs avoid.

In fast-growing orgs, these forces converge: “Let’s solve it once, centrally, and share the solution.” That feels efficient. But in practice? It’s often where flexibility goes to die.

The result is a well-intentioned mess, where centralized infra slowly becomes both scapegoat and bottleneck. Not because it was built poorly, but because it absorbed too much responsibility.

# In Modern Systems

The End-to-End Principle still applies:

- In **microservices**, each service should own its logic.
- In **serverless**, don’t stuff your entire auth stack into API Gateway.
- In **internal platforms**, resist the urge to do too much.

# 🚀 Looking Forward

As we adopt **platform engineering**, **AI agents**, and **event-driven architectures**, the pressure to centralize smarts will grow. Teams will want self-service, reusable infra that “just works.” But the risks don’t go away.

- AI-assisted deployments: Tools may rewrite configs, infer parameters, or auto-tune thresholds without explaining why.
- Declarative pipelines: GitOps and CI/CD systems may centralize control loops, but overreaching logic creates silent dependencies.
- Orchestration layers: Systems like Temporal or Step Functions can encode workflow logic that’s hard to reason about and harder to change.

These tools are powerful, but unless you draw a firm boundary between “execution plumbing” and “business reasoning,” you’ll find yourself debugging YAML and DAGs instead of application code.

If we’re not careful, we’ll centralize so much logic into pipelines, bots, and policies that no one remembers how anything works. Or worse: no one can fix it when it breaks.

The smarter our infrastructure gets, the more we need to revisit the principle that started it all: **Keep the smarts at the edge. Keep the core simple.**

# Final Thought

The End-to-End Principle isn’t about purity. It’s about knowing the cost of hiding complexity in the middle. If you’re going to violate it, at least know when you’re making that trade.

Because the next time something fails, you’ll want to know exactly who made what decision, and why.

And if no one can answer that?  
That’s not smart infrastructure.  
That’s technical debt with a fancy UI.

Zooming out, this principle isn’t just a technical choice, it’s a strategic one. Systems that preserve clarity, autonomy, and ownership scale better across teams, tools, and time. If you want a resilient engineering culture, it starts by pushing complexity back to where it belongs: the people who understand it best.
