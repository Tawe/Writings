## A tactical guide to building role-based AI assistants inside Cursor, from product planning to production deployment.

![5 Cursor Personas Your Whole Team Should Be Using (Not Just Devs)](5cursorpersonas.webp)

When I first started using Cursor, I thought I just needed better prompts. What I really needed was a better perspective multiple ones, actually. I didn’t need one assistant. I needed five. That’s when I started thinking in **personas**.

Personas are distinct ways of configuring prompts, `.cursorrules`, and context scope for specific workflows. They aren't just role-based metaphors, they’re tactical, role-specific setups that reflect how different people think, prioritize, and communicate within a codebase.

They won’t solve everything. Some teams may prefer one general-purpose assistant, and switching modes mid-flow can be jarring or overkill. But if you’ve ever wished your AI could sound more like your PM or less like a code generator and more like a reviewer, you might find these useful.

Here are five Cursor personas we’ve tested that map surprisingly well to real-world team roles. That said, if you’re a solo developer or a team of two, switching between personas might feel like overhead. They tend to shine most with teams of 3-8 people, where role boundaries start to emerge but there’s still shared context. Sometimes, one flexible assistant is enough, especially when speed is the priority over process.

## The Product Manager (a.k.a. The Synthesizer)

_“Can you summarize this into a Jira ticket with acceptance criteria… and make it readable by a non-dev?”_

**Why this works:** PMs need high-signal summaries, stakeholder-friendly clarity, and repeatable documentation. Cursor can take the chaos of dev threads and turn them into structured, readable briefs.

**What they use Cursor for:**

- Turning changelogs into stakeholder updates
- Drafting feature specs from Slack threads or PRs
- Writing acceptance criteria and outlining edge cases

**Go-to prompts:**

- “Summarize this PR for product/stakeholders in 2-3 concise sentences.”
- “Generate a ticket description with context, goals, and non-functional requirements.”

**Cursor Setup:**

- Limit context to `/features/`, `/tickets/`, and `/docs/`
- Emphasize summary tone and avoid technical jargon

**🧩 Setting It Up as a Custom Mode:** Save as `.cursor/rules/pm.mdc` with `Always` mode enabled. Or, create a [Custom Mode](https://docs.cursor.sh/docs/Custom-Modes) with instructions like: “You are a senior product manager…”

## The SEO Specialist (a.k.a. The Optimizer)

_“Let’s make this readable by humans and findable by search engines.”_

**Why this works:** This persona focuses on clarity, keyword alignment, and on-page structure. It helps bring AI into dev-marketing handoffs without touching code.

**What they use Cursor for:**

- Reviewing content for search friendliness
- Improving metadata and headings
- Generating alt text and canonical links

**Go-to prompts:**

- “Improve this paragraph’s readability and keyword focus on ‘affiliate platform’.”
- “Audit this HTML block for SEO gaps (meta tags, alt text, headings).”

**Cursor Setup:**

- Enable access to `/marketing/`, `/public/`, or `/pages/`
- Disable code suggestions, boost markdown and HTML fluency

**🧩 Setting It Up as a Custom Mode:** Create a mode with soft language output and markdown focus. Add the instruction: “You are an SEO specialist optimizing content for organic visibility.”

## The Senior Developer (a.k.a. The Architect)

_“This works. But does it scale? Does it belong here?”_

**Why this works:** This persona helps flag long-term tradeoffs that juniors might miss. It’s not about style. It’s about strategy.

**What they use Cursor for:**

- Enforcing architecture patterns
- Reviewing PRs for structure and testability
- Flagging scope creep and premature optimization

**Go-to prompts:**

- “Review this approach against our event-driven architecture.”
- “Identify refactor opportunities for readability and long-term flexibility.”

**Cursor Setup:**

- Full access to repo with design docs as bonus context
- Enable audit-mode tone and best-practice recommendations

**🧩 Setting It Up as a Custom Mode:** Custom mode with rule like: “You are a senior software architect. Evaluate code for maintainability and long-term scalability.”

## The Database Sage (a.k.a. The Guardian of State)

_“It’s not about the query — it’s about the long-term cost of the query.”_

**Why this works:** Query performance and schema drift are invisible until they hurt. This persona puts the brakes on shipping risky DB changes by default.

**What they use Cursor for:**

- Reviewing ORM queries for risk
- Validating schema decisions
- Recommending index or constraint improvements

**Go-to prompts:**

- “Review this SQL query for potential bottlenecks or index issues.”
- “Evaluate whether the schema supports this access pattern effectively.”

**Cursor Setup:**

- Narrow file context to `/models/`, `/migrations/`, `/db/`
- Add performance and safety guidance rules

**🧩 Setting It Up as a Custom Mode:** Instruction: “You are a senior database engineer. Evaluate every query for risk, indexing, and maintainability.”

## The DevOps Master (a.k.a. The Risk Reducer)

_“You deployed fast. But can you explain how you’d roll it back?”_

**Why this works:** DevOps personas bring caution and control to systems that often grow in complexity without visibility. This profile helps surface risk, without blocking flow.

**What they use Cursor for:**

- Reviewing CI/CD pipelines and deployment scripts
- Auditing infrastructure as code
- Proposing rollback and fallback plans

**Go-to prompts:**

- “Audit this deployment script for insecure defaults or missing validations.”
- “Draft a rollback and recovery plan for this Terraform config.”

**Cursor Setup:**

- Prioritize `.github/`, `/infra/`, `/deploy/` folders
- Disable Max Mode by default; log every change suggestion

**🧩 Setting It Up as a Custom Mode:** Setup rule to flag any destructive operations. Instruction: “You are a cautious DevOps engineer. Suggest secure and reversible approaches.”

## Before and After: A Real Workflow Example (React + Analytics)

You can simulate a real team by chaining Cursor personas:

- Start with the **Product Manager** for planning
- Switch to **Senior Dev** for implementation
- Finish with **DevOps** or **Database Sage** for review

**Before (Default Cursor Use):** A developer receives a vague feature request. They try to generate code directly in Cursor, but it lacks context. The PR ends up needing rework because it missed product goals, SEO guidelines, and introduced a risky database query.

**After (Using Personas):**

- The **Product Manager persona** rewrites the vague request into a clear spec with edge cases.
- The **SEO persona** reviews copy in the component before code is merged.
- The **Senior Developer persona** ensures the architecture fits existing patterns.
- The **Database Sage** spots an N+1 query and suggests an index.
- The **DevOps Master** proposes a safer deployment script with rollback.

With personas, the team delivered a clearer, safer, and more performant feature:

- The PM persona clarified requirements.
- The SEO persona ensured search-friendly content.
- The Senior Dev ensured performance.
- The DB Sage flagged a slow join.
- The DevOps Master confirmed rollout safety.

Instead of a late-cycle rewrite, most of these issues were surfaced during development.

# Persona Quick Reference Table

## A Note on Format, Modes, and Tradeoffs

Cursor’s persona system evolved:

- Old format: `.cursorrules` (single-file project-wide rules)
- New format: `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` with scoping and tool control

Use [Project Rules](https://docs.cursor.sh/docs/Project-Rules) for modular persona design.

**Custom Mode vs** `**.cursor/rules**`**:**

- **Custom Modes** are fast to toggle and great for role-switching in the moment.
- `**.cursor/rules/**` **files** offer more precision (per-folder or per-language scope), ideal for team-wide workflows.
- Use Modes when you’re experimenting. Use project rules when you want reliability.

## How Long Does It Take?

Setting up your first persona takes about 5-10 minutes once you’ve defined your role’s tone and scope. You can start from a single rule file or explore presets to speed things up.

## Want to Experiment Further?

These tools are optional but helpful in specific situations:

- The [Cursor Rule Maker](https://cursorrules.agnt.one/) is great if you’re building multiple personas quickly or want structure out of the box.
- GitHub gists and open-source repos are useful if you’re looking to see how others structure similar personas or workflows.

You don’t need tooling to get started, just a thoughtful rule and consistent usage pattern.
