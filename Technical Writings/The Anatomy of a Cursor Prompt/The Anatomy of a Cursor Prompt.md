# 🧪 A Quick Example: Renaming a Function

You ask Cursor: “Can you rename `validateLogin` to `checkLogin`?”

Here’s what really happens:

1. Cursor captures your current file, cursor location, and nearby code.
2. The system prompt reminds the model how to behave, what tools it can use, and how to format edits.
3. The model decides it needs to use the `edit_file` tool.
4. Cursor sends the model the tool schema, the code context, and your question. All bundled into a **single prompt payload**. This doesn’t mean one sentence. It means Cursor constructs a multi-part, structured input and sends it all at once to the model as a single API request.
5. The model outputs a tool call like this:

{  
  "tool": "edit_file",  
  "parameters": {  
    "target_file": "src/auth.js",  
    "instructions": "Rename validateLogin to checkLogin",  
    "code_edit": "```diff  
- function validateLogin(user) {  
+ function checkLogin(user) {```  
  }  
}

6. Cursor applies the edit, checks for issues, and responds with the final result.

That simple rename request involved tooling, code context, live state, and a multi-step interaction. And it all fit inside a single prompt package.

# **What Actually Gets Sent to the Model, and Why It Matters**

You type a message into Cursor. The AI replies. Simple, right?

Not quite.

Behind the scenes, Cursor constructs one of the most complex, multi-layered prompts in the developer tooling world, weaving together everything from your cursor position to persistent team rules, code search results, tool schemas, and even the way it wants the model to _think_. It’s not just “chat history + question.” It’s an orchestration.

Here’s what really makes up a Cursor prompt, and why understanding it can make you a better user (and a safer one). Along the way, we’ll also celebrate what makes this system incredibly powerful for modern development workflows.

## 1. Hidden Instructions: The System Prompt

Every request starts with a large block of system instructions that the user never sees, but the model always does. This system prompt sets the stage: tone, role, behavioral rules, and tool usage policies. It includes:

- **Identity framing**: “You are a powerful coding assistant working in Cursor….”
- **Behavioral rules**: Be professional but conversational, format in Markdown, never lie, no oversharing.
- **Tool-calling etiquette**: Use tools silently, explain why before using them, follow strict schemas.
- **Code editing norms**: Prefer edit tools over dumping code. Ensure changes are runnable and clean.
- **Debugging best practices**: Walk through steps logically, isolate errors, explain fixes.
- **Special modes**: YOLO mode for terse replies. Custom rules per team/project.

**Why it matters**: You may think you’re just chatting, but you’re really triggering a carefully scoped, policy-bound agent that’s pretending to be casual.

## 2. Code Context: What the Model Sees From Your Project

Cursor is a semantic IDE. That means it tries to preload your working memory for you. Bringing in the most relevant code snippets, file metadata, or even your cursor position. Context includes:

- **Current file content**
- **Recently viewed files**
- **Semantic search results**
- **Language server insights**
- **Linter/compile errors**
- **Edit history**
- **Your cursor location (literally “here”)**
- **Images or screenshots (OCR processed)**

This is all packed into the prompt, and while Cursor now supports persistent Memory for high-level context (like goals or preferences), any memory that gets included in a prompt **does count against the token budget**, just like code or chat history. Most dynamic project state (like open files or edits) is still re-injected on each request. In practice, **each prompt still carries the bulk of its working context explicitly**.

**Why it matters**: If your `.env` is open, it's in the context (unless excluded via `.cursorignore`). If your prompt is too long, something gets trimmed. And if Cursor gets it wrong? The assistant may hallucinate, overwrite, or misread scope.

## 3. Tools: The Hands and Eyes of the Assistant

Cursor’s agent can search files, grep text, read and edit code, and run commands. Each tool is defined inline via a JSON schema, name, description, parameters, examples. These schemas tell the model exactly how to invoke the tool, such as providing a `target_file` or a `query` string for search.

Common tools include:

- `codebase_search` – semantic vector search
- `read_file` – reads N lines at a time
- `edit_file` – proposes file diffs
- `run_terminal_cmd` – executes safe shell commands
- `list_dir`, `grep_search`, `file_search`, `delete_file`, and more

**Why it matters**: Every tool call is parsed from the model’s output, and executed. A formatting mistake or misunderstanding of available context can lead to wasted cycles or bad edits.

## 4. Live Session State: What’s Changed So Far

To keep continuity across turns, Cursor includes:

- **Edit history**: e.g. “Edited `main.py`: renamed `foo()` to `bar()`”
- **Compiler/linter feedback**
- **User instructions**: e.g., “Use Python 3.10 features” preserved between turns

This acts like a form of **ephemeral memory**, reassembled per prompt. Since no true long-term memory is retained by the model itself, Cursor meticulously rebuilds this context every time to maintain coherence across turns.

**Why it matters**: The model doesn’t “remember” unless it’s told again — Cursor includes this context every time to make multi-turn interactions coherent.

## 5. Conversation History: The Human Part

Your chat history (user and assistant messages) is included in each prompt:

- Older exchanges are removed if the conversation gets too long
- Recent exchanges are formatted in a structured way for the model

**Why it matters**: The model only sees what fits. If history gets long, you may lose reference to earlier ideas or decisions.

# Cursor in Action: Real-World Use Cases

## Cross-File Refactor

You ask Cursor: “Extract the validation logic from `form.tsx` into a shared utility and update both `form.tsx` and `signup.tsx` to use it.”

Here’s what Cursor might do under the hood:

1. Use `codebase_search` to find `validateInput` logic in `form.tsx`
2. Use `read_file` to fetch the entire function and surrounding imports
3. Propose a new file: `utils/validation.ts` containing the extracted function
4. Update imports in both `form.tsx` and `signup.tsx` using `edit_file`
5. Ensure references and paths are valid (may do additional `read_file` or `list_dir` checks)
6. Summarize changes back to you in a conversational reply

What looks like a smart rewrite actually involves orchestration of 5+ steps, multiple files, semantic search, and tool chaining.

## Debugging a Crash

You ask Cursor: “Why does my app crash when I click ‘Submit’?”

Here’s how Cursor might handle it behind the scenes:

1. The assistant sees that the request requires deeper context.
2. It issues a `codebase_search` tool call with a query like “submit crash” or “handleSubmit”.
3. Cursor returns a list of relevant files (e.g., `form.tsx`, `submit-handler.ts`, and a recent error log).
4. The assistant reads those files using `read_file` (chunked if needed).
5. It discovers a reference to an undefined variable in the handler.
6. It replies with: “Looks like `submitResponse` is undefined in `submit-handler.ts`. I suggest initializing it based on the API result.”

What looks like a single, fluent response might be the result of 3–6 internal tool calls and several round trips. All of it orchestrated through prompt chaining.

# Wait, What’s a Token? (And Why Should You Care?)

> _Try it yourself:_ [_OpenAI Tokenizer Tool_](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer)

When we say “token,” we’re talking about the chunks of text that language models actually process. A token might be a full word (“console”), part of a word (“initializ” + “e”), or even punctuation (“()” counts as one or two tokens).

Models like GPT-4 and Claude don’t see raw text, they see tokens. And every interaction has a maximum token budget that includes:

- 🧱 System instructions
- 📂 Code context
- 💬 Conversation history
- 🤖 The model’s response

This limit is called the context window. Cursor must fit _everything,_ code, tools, messages, your query, inside it.

## **Example: Rough Token Math**

Let’s say:

- System prompt + tools = 2,000 tokens
- Code context = 6,000 tokens
- Conversation history = 4,000 tokens
- Your current message = 1,000 tokens

Total so far: 13,000 tokens. That leaves room for a 7,000-token response before hitting the 20k limit in Standard Mode.

If you go over, Cursor silently trims. Often from older messages or unused files.

**Cursor’s Token Limits:**

- Standard Mode: ~20k tokens (practical working limit)
- Max Mode: Uses the full model capacity (100k–200k depending on model)

**Underlying Model Capacities:**

- GPT-4 Turbo: ~128k tokens
- Claude Opus: ~200k tokens

**Why it matters:** If your total context exceeds the limit, Cursor will automatically prune older messages, context, or code snippets, and that might break continuity or confuse the model. You don’t see this trimming, but it’s happening behind the scenes.

# Agent Mode Flow: Behind the Scenes

In Agent Mode, Cursor doesn’t always answer your question in a single pass. Instead, it may perform multiple steps behind the scenes:

1. Model interprets your query
2. Outputs a tool call (e.g., search or read)
3. Cursor executes the tool
4. Result is injected into the next prompt
5. Model re-evaluates with updated context
6. Repeats until it reaches a final answer

**Why it matters:** This orchestration makes Cursor feel smart, but it’s really a chain of prompt→tool→prompt loops. Each step costs tokens and can be pruned or misunderstood if not scoped cleanly.

# Be Careful What You Leave Open

Cursor includes open files, logs, and terminal outputs in the prompt. Even if they weren’t part of your question. That means:

- `.env` files, secrets, and keys can be exposed
- Logs with error messages or tokens can steer the model (prompt injection)
- Stack traces can introduce dangerous assumptions

**Tip:** Close sensitive files before prompting. Sanitize error messages. Use `.cursorignore` aggressively.

# Debugging Prompt Weirdness

When Cursor behaves oddly, forgets context, makes irrelevant suggestions, or over-edits. It’s often due to prompt construction limits.

Here’s what to check:

- Are irrelevant files open?
- Is `.cursorignore` excluding noisy folders?
- Are you referencing files explicitly with `@file` or `@symbol`?
- Has the prompt grown too long?

**Tip:** Rerun your request after reducing context noise.

# You Can’t See the Token Count (Yet)

Cursor doesn’t currently expose real-time token usage. If you’re hitting limits, it silently trims context.

- Feature requests exist to show token breakdowns, which would give users greater control and understanding of context trimming
- Until then, assume 20k–30k is the safe working budget in Standard Mode

**Tip:** Use Max Mode if you’re working across very large files or multi-step chains, but know it increases cost.

# How Tool Results Are Injected

When a tool is used, Cursor formats its results into the next prompt using structured tags or raw text. This is invisible to the user.

Example:

- The result of `read_file` may appear in the next prompt as:

<file_snippet> // File: utils.js function isValid() {...} </file_snippet>

**Why it matters:** The model doesn’t know what was fetched unless the tool result is well-structured. Poor formatting = bad answers.

# Good vs. Bad Prompts: A Quick Comparison

Sometimes the difference between a helpful answer and a confused one comes down to how you ask. Cursor isn’t just parsing your words, it’s working with the surrounding code and state. But clarity still matters.

## ❌ Bad Prompt:

> _“Why is this broken?”_

- Ambiguous. No code reference, no error, no filename.
- Cursor might pull in too much or too little context.

## ✅ Good Prompt:

> _“Why is_ `_submitResponse_` _undefined when I click the button in_ `_form.tsx_`_? I think it connects to_ `_submit-handler.ts_`_, which is already imported."_

- Includes error context, symbol name, likely file, and a relationship hint.
- Cursor can semantically search and zero in on the actual issue faster.

**Tip:** Think of your prompt like a bug report. You’re briefing a very fast, obedient teammate who doesn’t know what you looked at two minutes ago.

# The Donut Effect: What Gets Forgotten When You’re Out of Room

> _💬_ **_New in Cursor_**_: When the current thread runs out of room and trimming becomes too aggressive, Cursor may suggest starting a_ **_new conversation_**_. This helps reset context while still letting you refer back to the old chat if needed. It’s a sign that your session has grown beyond what fits in a single prompt window, and a reminder to re-anchor your goal clearly in the new thread._

Research shows that language models have a “lost in the middle” problem. They pay strong attention to the beginning and end of context, but largely ignore the middle. Combined with Cursor’s token trimming.

This creates a “donut effect”:

- The beginning (system prompt, tool schemas) is intact
- The end (your latest question) is intact
- But the **middle** (chat history, file context, previous answers) is gone

**Symptoms:**

- The assistant forgets something you _just said_
- Cursor suggests a fix it already tried
- Answers lack continuity in a long back-and-forth

**Mitigation:**

- Keep chat focused. Split long threads into new sessions
- Close irrelevant files
- Use `@file` to re-anchor key context manually

# Token Budgeting Strategies

When your prompt gets long, Cursor must decide what to keep, and what to cut. You can guide that process by designing prompts and environments with budgeting in mind.

> Think like an architect, not just a user.

**Prioritize critical context:**

- Open only relevant files
- Avoid long code blocks unless needed
- Use `@file`, `@function`, or `@code` to precisely fetch snippets
- Summarize where possible (“I’m working on a form handler that fails on submit”)

**Minimize conversational overhead:**

- Avoid repeating questions or setup from earlier turns
- If the AI seems to forget, re-anchor it with `@file` or `#` tags rather than long prose

**Reduce ambiguity:**

- Cursor tries to keep everything you touched, sometimes too much
- If you’ve moved on from an issue, consider refreshing the session or closing files

**Use** `**.cursorignore**` **proactively:**

- Prevent large or irrelevant files from being indexed or added
- Especially useful in monorepos or legacy codebases

**Pro tip**: The more you curate your workspace, the less Cursor has to guess.

# Prompt Assembly: How Cursor Builds the Final Input

Cursor builds prompts server-side using a custom engine called **Priompt**. This engine dynamically decides what to include based on available token space and task relevance. As your prompt grows, Priompt intelligently prioritizes:

- Keeping system instructions and tool definitions
- Retaining the most recent user message and its direct context
- Trimming or summarizing older history and low-priority files

The order typically looks like this:

1. **User/Project Rules** (from `.cursor/rules`)
2. **System Instructions + Tool Schemas**
3. **Live Context (code, errors, cursor, screenshots)**
4. **Conversation history (pruned if needed)**
5. **User query (clearly delimited)**

If tools are used mid-prompt, Cursor may iterate:

- Query → tool call → result → re-prompt → final answer

> **_Why it matters_**_: Every prompt is a full reassembly. Cursor is a stateless wrapper around a structured memory emulation engine.. Cursor is a stateless wrapper around a structured memory emulation engine._
