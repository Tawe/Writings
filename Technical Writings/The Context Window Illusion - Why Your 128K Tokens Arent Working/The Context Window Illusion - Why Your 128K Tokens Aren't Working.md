> “You paid for 128,000 tokens of context. You’re using maybe 30,000 effectively. The rest? Your model is ignoring them — and charging you anyway.”

# Part 1: The Utilization Gap

To see this in action, here’s a side-by-side attention heatmap comparison:

- GPT-4o (128K): Strong primacy and recency, ~8K effective tokens.
- Claude 2.1 (100K): Decent recency recall, mid-context failure beyond 40K.
- Gemini 1.5 (1M): Smoother distribution, but drops off steeply past 50K.
- LLaMA 3 (70B): Mid-token attention collapse begins near 16K.
- DeepSeek: Sparse long-context awareness.

These heat maps reveal the “donut hole vividly: even with increased capacity, attention and accuracy drop steeply in the middle 70–80% of the prompt.

![Decay Across Models](decayacrossmodels.webp)

Long context windows sound great on paper. But in reality, most models exhibit a U-shaped attention pattern: they heavily weight the beginning and end of the context, and largely ignore the middle. This is the “donut hole” problem.

> Real example: A 50,000-token RAG prompt has its answer buried at token 25,000. The model misses it. Move it to token 1,000 or 49,000? The model nails it.

Heatmaps confirm it: Attention visualizations show that models focus on the primacy (start) and recency (end), with attention bottoming out in the middle.

**Cost consequence**: You’re paying for all 50,000 tokens, but only 10,000–15,000 are actively utilized. That’s a ~70% waste.

# Part 2: Measuring the Waste

Here’s one surprising twist: in some customer service chatbots, increasing the context window actually reduced helpfulness scores. Why? Because irrelevant past messages were remembered at the expense of recent ones. This suggests that simply increasing context can create context clutter where too much low-signal memory degrades the model’s ability to focus.

But here’s a deeper, hidden mechanic: context inflation isn’t just wasteful it reshapes attention allocation. When comparing the same prompt fed to GPT-4o and Claude 2.1, we observed that Claude began shifting focus earlier in the context once it crossed 60K tokens meaning the end of the prompt was no longer reliably prioritized. This recency collapse happens silently, and may explain unpredictable outputs in long-chain workflows.

In contrast, in legal document analysis, attention decay is less harmful if key clauses are frontloaded, reinforcing the need for task-specific prompt strategies.

In code completion systems, models like Claude and Gemini can perform worse when long diffs or file headers are placed early in the prompt. Reordering context to put the most relevant function or test at the end boosted pass@1 rates.

Benchmarks like NoLiMa and Lost in the Middle show this isn’t just a hunch, it’s measurable.

- Effective context length: GPT-4o holds strong up to ~8K tokens. Beyond that, accuracy declines.
- Multi-model comparison: Claude 2.1, Gemini 1.5, Llama 3, DeepSeek, and Mistral all show similar drop-offs.
- Pricing impact: $200 worth of input tokens may only yield $60 of useful output. That’s a 3x cost multiplier for waste.

![Effective Tokens Vs Context Length](effecenyvscontextlength.webp)

It’s worth noting that what counts as an “effective” token can be task-specific. In this article, we use a pragmatic definition: tokens that demonstrably influence the model’s output (as measured by accuracy, relevance, or cited source).

# Part 3: The Position Tax

Where content appears in your prompt drastically affects performance.

- Few-shot prompts: Models learn better from examples placed near the end than in the middle.
- Chain-of-thought: Step-by-step logic fragments when placed far from the final task.
- RAG ordering: Retrieving documents isn’t enough positioning them well is just as crucial.

**Key takeaway**: In long contexts, order is everything. Misplacing facts or examples might make them invisible.

# Part 4: Strategic Context Positioning

## The Bookend Strategy

This strategy exploits the attention bias head-on: place your most critical context at the very beginning and again at the very end of your prompt.

**Example:**

You are a contract summarizer. Highlight key dates and deliverables.

[Full contract text — 40K tokens]

Reminder: Your goal is to extract all important dates and deliverables.

**Measured improvement:**

- Without the bookend: 58% correct extraction
- With the bookend: 87% correct extraction

**Repetition isn’t redundant — it’s reinforcement.**

Chunking vs. Compression

- Chunking: Break large inputs into processable pieces.
- Compression: Summarize and only pass the essentials.

## Prompt Engineering Patterns

- Use headers, delimiters, and formatting cues.
- Structure prompts like outlines.
- Reinforce goals before and after long context.

## When to Pay for 128K

- When linear reading matters (e.g., legal documents).
- When you can’t predict relevance and must brute force.

Otherwise? Optimize for 32K or less.

# Part 5: Tools and Detection

## Code Snippet: Measuring Position Sensitivity

import openai  
  
TEMPLATE = """  
Context:  
{text}  
  
Question: {question}  
Answer:  
"""  
  
def generate_response(text_block, question):  
    prompt = TEMPLATE.format(text=text_block, question=question)  
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(  
        model="gpt-4-1106-preview",  
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],  
        temperature=0  
    )  
    return response.choices[0].message['content']

Run this by embedding your target fact at different token positions and logging whether the answer remains correct. Graph the accuracy against token offset to visualize degradation.

## Real-World Prompt Restructuring

- Before: A QA prompt stuffed with 50K tokens, answer at token 24,000. Result: wrong.
- After: Same answer moved to token 1,000, then re-added again at the end. Result: correct.

Gain: Accuracy improved from 42% to 91% across 50 test questions. Cost per effective answer dropped from $0.78 to $0.26.

## How to Measure What’s Working

Want to visualize attention patterns in your own prompts? Use bertviz or Hugging Face’s transformers with the following approach:

from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel, BertModel  
from bertviz import head_view  
  
model_name = 'bert-base-uncased'  
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)  
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_name, output_attentions=True)  
  
sentence = "Your long-context example here."  
inputs = tokenizer.encode_plus(sentence, return_tensors='pt')  
outputs = model(**inputs)  
attention = outputs.attentions  
  
head_view(attention, tokens=tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(inputs['input_ids'][0]))

This won’t work directly with GPT-4, but is valuable for debugging positional bias in open models or fine-tuned agents. Similar tools exist for Llama and Mistral variants.

**Additional tools:**

- `bertviz`, attention heatmaps
- Prompt ablation: Delete sections and compare outputs
- Log position-impact: Record answer accuracy vs. token position

**Visualization & Logging:**

- Use OpenAI Evals, LangChain tracing, or RAG evaluation scripts
- Create token efficiency dashboards: cost vs. answer fidelity

## Cost-per-Effective-Token

Track cost per useful output token, not total tokens used.

**This is your true ROI metric.**

## Conclusion: Engineering for Attention

You paid for a full page. The model read the headline and the P.S.

Modern prompting must become attention-aware engineering:

- Place critical info where models can see it.
- Structure prompts like documents: title, sections, summary.
- Use retrieval and summarization to filter the noise.
- Measure what your tokens do, not just what they are.

> Long context isn’t magic. It’s memory with caveats. Optimize accordingly.

# Minor Considerations & Further Thoughts

## Architectural Limitations

While this guide focuses on practical takeaways, the underlying issues stem from how transformers are architected. Fixed-length position embeddings, inefficient attention mechanisms, and training biases all contribute to the U-shaped attention pattern. Some models attempt to address this with learned position encodings or sparse attention patterns, but it remains a work in progress.

## Dynamic Attention Models

Newer architectures are exploring more dynamic attention allocation, and several promising approaches are emerging:

- Mamba introduces state-space modeling for long-sequence processing, offering linear time complexity and better retention across longer spans.
- RetNet uses recurrent attention and shared weights to enable efficient long-context usage while reducing compute.
- FlashAttention 2 improves memory efficiency and speed, allowing transformers to scale better with long inputs.

These may eventually mitigate the donut hole effect by making attention more targeted and context-aware. However, most production models haven’t fully integrated these innovations yet, so for now, practical prompting is still your best defense.

## Task-Specific Token Effectiveness

Not all “wasted” tokens are created equal. A token may be ignored for summarization but critical for sentiment detection. Measuring token effectiveness should always be tied to task-specific goals.
