## You didn’t write an inefficient prompt. You just paid for tokens the model ignored.

> _Prompt engineering is often seen as a craft of clever wording, but behind the scenes, another force quietly shapes outcomes: token efficiency. Understanding the trade-offs between zero-shot and few-shot approaches will unlock new ways to optimize both output quality and resource consumption._

## The Quick Take

You didn't write a bad prompt—your model just read too much. That's the hidden danger of few-shot prompting: it feels efficient, but it might be costing you far more tokens than it returns in quality.

A simple keyword extraction task uses ~26 tokens with zero-shot but ~88 tokens with few-shot prompting. Same task. Over 3x the tokens. Multiply this by 10,000 API calls and you're burning $80 instead of $24.

## The Token Tax Reality

Token consumption grows rapidly as you add examples, but performance improvements follow diminishing returns:

| Prompt Style | Prompt Length (tokens) | GPT-4o Cost (@$0.03/1K tokens) |
|--------------|------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Zero-shot    | 35                     | $0.00105                       |
| One-shot     | 72                     | $0.00216                       |
| Few-shot (3) | 164                    | $0.00492                       |

The first few examples improve accuracy sharply. Additional examples yield smaller boosts, plateauing by 4–5 examples.

## Format Efficiency Matters

Not all tokens are created equal. The format of your prompt can add invisible weight:

- **JSON Format**: `{"name": "Alice", "role": "engineer"}` → ~22 tokens
- **Markdown Format**: `- Name: Alice\n- Role: engineer` → ~15 tokens  
- **Plain Text**: `Name: Alice, Role: engineer` → ~13 tokens

JSON includes quotes, colons, and braces—all of which consume tokens unnecessarily.

## Strategic Token Budgeting

Think of your prompt as a token budget. Spend it where it earns the most value:

**Use examples when:**
- Tasks are ambiguous or format-sensitive
- Domain-specific terminology is required
- Creative or stylistic emulation is needed

**Use instructions when:**
- Tasks are straightforward
- Models already understand the domain
- Format requirements can be clearly described

### Real-World Trade-Off Example

Instead of three examples for summarization (60–80 tokens), try this instruction tweak (17 tokens):

```
Summarize the following article concisely, using exactly three distinct bullet points. Each point should cover a main idea without redundancy.
```

Same accuracy gain, massive token savings.

## The Memorization Paradox

LLMs are trained on vast corpora and often already "know" the task. For common use cases like summarization, translation, and Q&A, adding examples can be redundant.

**Zero-shot**: `Translate the sentence into French: "How are you today?"`
**Few-shot**: Multiple examples + the same task

Same output. More tokens. Instruction-tuned models like GPT-4 and Claude 3 perform remarkably well without examples in these domains.

## When Few-Shot Is Worth the Cost

Despite the token tax, few-shot prompting is essential for:

- **Domain-specific tasks**: Medical data classification, legal clauses
- **Format-sensitive outputs**: Complex structured formats that are hard to describe
- **Alignment constraints**: Subtle examples that illustrate boundaries
- **Creative emulation**: Tone, pacing, or stylistic nuance

High-quality examples can do what verbose instructions can't. Here, paying the token tax is a wise investment.

## Model-Specific Considerations

Different models tokenize differently—even for the same text:

| Model      | Tokenizer                    | Token Count for "John loves writing technical articles." |
|------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| GPT-4o     | Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE)     | 9                                                        |
| Claude 3   | SentencePiece                | 8                                                        |
| Mistral 7B | BPE (custom merge rules)     | 10                                                       |

That's up to a 20% variance for the same string. Token efficiency analysis must be model-specific.

## Engineering for Efficiency

Token-efficient prompting means:

✅ **Starting with zero-shot**  
✅ **Adding only high-leverage examples**  
✅ **Choosing formats that reduce token weight**  
✅ **Prioritizing precision over verbosity**  
✅ **Matching examples to model knowledge**  
✅ **Testing trade-offs between instructions and demonstrations**  
✅ **Avoiding context overflow from prompt bloat**

## What Makes a High-Leverage Example?

A high-leverage example punches above its weight in guiding model behavior:

- It clarifies a tricky edge case
- It demonstrates a complex format that's hard to describe  
- It prevents a frequent misinterpretation

If your example solves one of these, it's likely worth the tokens.

## Tools for Token Tracking

- **OpenAI's library**: Inspect token counts before sending prompts
- **Anthropic, Mistral tokenizers**: Model-specific analysis tools
- **API metadata logging**: Most providers return token counts per request

Remember: You're not just feeding a model. You're buying its attention—one token at a time.

## Final Thought

The most expensive prompt isn't the one that costs the most tokens—it's the one that wastes them. Start lean, add strategically, and always measure the trade-off between token cost and quality gain.
